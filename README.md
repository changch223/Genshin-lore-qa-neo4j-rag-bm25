# Genshin Impact Hybrid QA System

**Genshin Impact Hybrid QA System** is a multi-source hybrid question-answering system built to explore the rich narrative of **Genshin Impact**.  
It integrates structured and unstructured data sources to answer lore-related queries with high factual accuracy and contextual nuance.


## Why This Project?

In lore-heavy games like Genshin Impact, finding concise, accurate story answers across thousands of wiki pages can be overwhelming.  
As a product manager passionate about AI, I built this system to explore:

- How hybrid retrieval architectures improve user trust and search satisfaction
- How GenAI (Google Gemini) can be grounded in facts from knowledge graphs and vector search
- How to design a GenAI-powered feature end-to-end, from crawling to UX

---

## What It Can Do

- **Rewrite** vague or informal questions into precise, search-optimized queries
- **Classify** query intent (e.g., character relationships, plot events, quest conditions)
- **Retrieve** answers from:
  - Neo4j Knowledge Graph
  - RAG using Gemini Embeddings + ChromaDB
  - BM25 keyword-based search
- **Generate** high-quality summaries grounded in retrieved facts
- **Visualize** entity relationships (e.g., "Who knows Paimon?")

> **Example Query:**  
> _"What's Paimon's deal with Zhongli?"_  
> â†’ Answer is synthesized from KG facts + narrative context + keyword clues

## Design Rationale

### Why Hybrid Retrieval?

| Method     | Strength                                | Use Case Example                            |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| KG (Neo4j) | Precise, structured, interpretable       | "Who does Zhongli know?"                     |
| RAG        | Handles paraphrasing + long-form queries | "Tell me the story behind Rex Lapis"        |
| BM25       | Fast fallback for keyword-heavy queries  | "Liyue act III ending explained"            |

- **Chunking Strategy**: `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`  
- **Embedding Model**: Gemini 1.5 Pro via `google-generativeai`  
- **Evaluation Method**: Manual comparison across KG, RAG, and BM25 retrieval outputs

## Outcomes & Learnings

- Designed an end-to-end QA system combining LLMs, classical information retrieval, and structured knowledge graphs  
- Practiced prompt engineering for Gemini with a focus on factual grounding  
- Gained hands-on experience with LangChainâ€™s multi-retriever orchestration  
- Built a practical, demo-ready artifact for my AI-focused product management portfolio
