# LoreLens: Genshin Impact Hybrid QA System

This project is a multi-source question-answering system that explores Genshin Impact's narrative universe using a hybrid of structured and unstructured data. Built with Neo4j, LangChain, Gemini API, and BM25, it retrieves facts from:

- Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)
- RAG with Gemini Embeddings + ChromaDB
- BM25 full-text retrieval

## What It Can Do

- Convert fuzzy user questions into optimized search queries
- Extract and visualize entity relationships from wiki text
- Classify query intent (e.g., character relationship, quest requirement)
- Retrieve facts via graph, semantic, and keyword channels
- Generate formal lore summaries grounded strictly in source data

> Example Query:  
> _"What's Paimon's deal with Zhongli?"_  
> â†’ A structured, source-grounded summary that draws from 3 retrieval methods.
