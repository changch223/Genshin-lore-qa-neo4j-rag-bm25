In conjunction with theArchon QuestWanderer's Trail, it serves as a tutorial level for movement and combat, and introduces some of the main characters.
During their travels across the worlds, theTravelerand theirtwin siblingare confronted by anunknown entityas they were about to depart. In the ensuing battle, the unknown entity seals off the sibling, before doing the same to the Traveler, sealing their powers and putting both of them in Teyvat.
The Traveler eventually wakes up after an undisclosed amount of time and proceeds to wander across Teyvat. The Traveler is aroundCape Oathwhen they fish outPaimonfrom the sea, thus saving her from drowning. Grateful for the rescue, Paimon becomes their travel companion and guide. She suggests they get in contact withThe Sevenin order to help the Traveler look for their lost sibling.
Making their way toStarfell Lake, the Traveler touches the AnemoStatue of The Sevenand they spot agreen dragonheading toward a distant forest.
Upon pursuing the dragon, the pair spot both the dragon anda stranger, the latter trying to calm the dragon down, but a reaction from the Traveler's newfound powers leads to them alerting the dragon to their presence. The stranger also flees, leaving behind acrimson blood colored teardrop crystalwhich the Traveler takes.
Once Paimon and the Traveler leave the forest, the pair are halted by a scout, who introduces herself as the Outrider of theKnights of Favonius,Amber. Amber offers to escort them toMondstadt, the City of Freedom, after she deals with aHilichurlcamp nearby which the Traveler and Paimon assist with.
Impressed by their actions at the camp, Amber gifts them aWind Glider. But after a test flight, the dragon that the Traveler and Paimon had previously sighted, dubbed "Stormterror" by the locals, starts rampaging throughout the region and unleashing multiple wind storms in the process. The Traveler, with the aid of the stranger (albeit unaware of his presence) is able to drive Stormterror off.
The confrontation between the Traveler and Stormterror catches the eye of the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius,Kaeya; thus he asks the Outlanders to meet the Acting Grandmaster,Jean, at theirprimary base of operations. Jean asks them to get a handle on the Ley Line disruptions powering Stormterror from three of the Four Winds' Temples, as prescribed byLisa, the Knights' Librarian.
After dealing with the temples, Paimon suggests that they return to the knights' headquarters to see what they should do next.

After theTravelerdealt with the Temples, they come back toMondstadtto report toJean. They find amasked womantalking to Jean, who suggests they kill the dragon to end the problem. Jean dismisses the woman, stating that she has no respect as she doesn't know that Stormterror is actuallyDvalin, one of theFour Winds. Jean then spots the two and explains to them that the woman she spoke to is aFatuidiplomat.
Regarding the dragon situation, the Traveler remembered the gem they foundat the forestearlier, hoping the Knights would know what it is. Lisa tries to study it, but it emits harmful energy towardsVisionusers, so the Traveler puts it back in their pockets. The Traveler knew the reason, but remains silent as Jean grants the title Honorary Knight to them.
Paimonhad known there was another presence when they found the gem, and subconsciously identified the boy running in the streets as the same person. After tracking down the stranger via his footprints with theirElemental Sight, the stranger sings the song of "Stormterror," identified as Dvalin, and the reason for his rampage. The stranger,Venti, recognizes the Traveler.
The Traveler takes out the gem, but to their surprise, it is purified. Venti then realizes that the Traveler's powers can assist in saving Dvalin and tells them to meet him at the place whereMondstadt's Herohad ascended toCelestiaâ€” the great tree inWindrise. The Traveler arrives at the great tree, but anEye of the Stormappears and the Traveler is forced to dispatch it first. Venti then explains to the pair that Dvalin is suffering from degradation, which theAbyss Orderis taking advantage of. He had tried to cure him earlier, but the Traveler's unexpected arrival ended up poisoning him, although he had recovered by then. Venti then tells them to meet him outside theFavonius Cathedralto get a certain "Holy Lyre der Himmel."
Entering the Cathedral, Venti asks SisterGotelindefor the lyre, even revealing his true identity as Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, but Gotelinde is not amused and believes he is insane. Venti then suggests the Traveler ask for it, which they do, but Gotelinde tells them that they need papers signed from the Grand Master, Seneschal, and Community Representative to do so, as it's only used in Ludi Harpastum at the moment.
The Traveler waits for the guards around the area to drop before sneaking into the vaults to take the lyre. Before they can do so, aFatui Electro Cicin Magewarps in and takes the lyre, just as a guard enters and spots them. Venti is relaxing outside when he hears Paimon screaming, telling him that they've been busted and need to run. Venti creates wind currents that drop them off near theAngel's Share, where he enters and tells ared-haired manto give them their least conspicuous table. The man is curious but agrees to their request; shortly after, two Knights appear and ask Diluc if he knows where the suspects went. He points them in the wrong direction.
With the Knights gone, Diluc then orders them down to ask what they were doing. Venti introduces the Traveler to Diluc, who recognizes them as the Honorary Knight, calling it a shame that they had joined theKnights of Favonius. Venti gives a performance to explain the situation to Diluc, who agrees to help them by organizing his contacts and telling them to meet the following night.
The following night, the pair find that Diluc has contacted Jean; both groups are surprised, but Diluc explains that the Jean before them is just there as the normal Jean, and not as the Acting Grand Master. Jean tells them that she is doing this in private because she has few options to act officially as the Acting Grand Master. She also believes in their cause, as she is aware of Dvalin's past. Diluc, having managed to interrogate some Fatui beforehand, tells them that the lyre is not in theGoth Grand Hotel, but in a stronghold outside the city premises.
The party manages to acquire the lyre after defeating several enemies, but not before aFatui Agentthreatens thatSignorawill end them. The lyre is in relatively poor shape however, so they acquire more Teardrop Crystals and purify them to fully restore the lyre. They then head toStarsnatch Cliffto summon Dvalin and purify him. However, anAbyss Mageappears and convinces Dvalin not to trust the group, resulting in Dvalin flying away and the lyre being completely broken.

Dilucbrings some information regarding theAbyss Orderto the group, having encountered and slain one of their operatives before.Ventiexplains that although he is one ofThe Seven, his long absences have led him to become the weakest of the group, hence why he needs to rely on his people's help.
Diluc informs the group that his people have tracked the mage down at the winery. After killing it, they note that it dissipated some special energy in the process. Venti realizes that this energy was what had been severing his connection toDvalin, who has since resided in someancient ruins. The energy also allowed him to understand the magic powering the barrier sealing the ruins, and he can dispel it.Jeanbelieves that they will need to kill Dvalin in order to bring peace, but Venti states that they can still achieve their original goal due to the Traveler's ability to purify theTeardrop Crystal.
After arriving outside Stormterror's Lair, they are attacked by a group ofHilichurls. They manage to repel their attackers, with Jean and Venti noting that hilichurls generally avoid elemental areas. Diluc states that the Abyss Order is manipulating the hilichurls in an attempt to stall them, but it that will not be enough. Venti then dispels the barrier.
As they navigate the lair and reach the top, Venti realizes they can't get any further, as the ruins are actually part ofold Mondstadt, from a time when the Anemo Archon was the tyrantDecarabian. He refuses to divulge more on the story for the time being. The group notes that there is a light actuator and activate it after some struggle. Venti hopes that they can bring Dvalin back to his senses, and convince him that neither the people of Mondstadt nor Venti himself had betrayed him in the first place. He then uses his powers to imbue the power with Anemo energy.
The Traveler catches up to Dvalin and manages to purge him of the corrupted energy placed on him by the Abyss Order. Dvalin saves the group, asking Venti why he did not ask him for his protection. Venti states that while he didn't want him to listen to the Abyss Order, he did not necessarily want him to obey Venti, either, and that if he had ordered him to act free, it wouldn't be true freedom. Dvalin then flies off, reassured that no one is after him. Meanwhile, Jean clears up the misunderstanding between the people and Dvalin, who they believed came out of nowhere to attack and disappeared just as quickly.
After returning to the city, the group is greeted by Amber, who reveals that while they were dealing with Dvalin, she and the other knights repelled a coordinated hilichurl attack on the city. She wondered whereKaeyahad gone during the attack, and tells them to meet up with her atGood Hunter. At the tavern, they find Kaeya, who tells them that he was suspicious of the attack and remained in the city while everyone else was fighting at the ancient ruins, intercepting a group of Abyss Order infiltrators and besting them. He learned from the infiltrators that the Abyss Order is united under asingle leader. Spotting Amber arriving, he takes his leave, aware that she is still angry at him for apparently abandoning the knights for a drink.
Amber is upset at Kaeya's supposed lack of work ethics, before asking the Traveler what they intend to do. Paimon tells her that they'll be traveling throughout Teyvat to meet The Seven. Amber wishes them luck on their journey, and that they will always be welcome in Mondstadt. After eating, she remembers that Jean asked for their presence at theCathedralregarding theHoly Lyre der Himmel.
The Traveler makes their way to the Cathedral, where they find Venti and Jean waiting for them. Jean introduces them toBarbara, the deaconess of the church, who asks for the lyre. The Traveler gives her a damaged lyre, much to her panic. Venti sighs and repairs the lyre, before Barbara takes it and runs off, intending to never let it out of her sights again. Venti chuckles and states that he simply used some magic to make it look as if it was fixed and runs off. The Traveler pursues him outside, upon which a gust of cold air freezes Venti and Paimon, sending the latter flying away.
TwoFatui Agentsappear and restrain the Traveler, whilea ladyand twoFatui Cicin Electro Magesenter the scene. The woman calls Venti a "rodent ruler" and continues to taunt Venti; he in turn returns the favor, enraging her; she then plunges her arm into his chest, ripping out hisGnosis. Signora orders her subordinates to quickly flee the scene before the Knights can arrive. One of the two agents backhands the Traveler, knocking them out cold.
The Traveler comes to sometime later, where Barbara had found the two. Venti came to first, but her healing had no effect on him, and he abruptly left. Jean appears to understand his intentions, but the Traveler decides to keep quiet for her sake. Jean and the Traveler arrive atWindrise, where they find Venti at the great tree and inquire about the Gnosis. Venti reluctantly explains to them what the Gnosis is. He also explains that the woman that attacked them isSignora, the eighth of theEleven Fatui Harbingersâ€” people who have been given great powers bySnezhnaya's Archon, theTsaritsa. Paimon realizes that the Tsaritsa is also one of The Seven who the Traveler is looking for.
Venti then explains more about the Tsaritsa, stating that although the current Seven usually don't get along well, they still respected each other. He is still surprised by the Tsaritsa's actions, but remarks that a "certain catastrophe" five hundred years ago severed their relationship completely. Venti suggests that they head toLiyueto speak with theGeo Archon, stating that he comes down once every year during the Rite of Descension to determine how the nation will progress. He urges them to head there immediately, or they will have to wait another year for the next rite if they miss the Geo Archon.

After being informed byVentithatRex Lapisis coming to Liyue this year to begin theRite of Descension, theTravelerandPaimonquickly rush toLiyueto meet the Geo Archon before he leaves.
Arriving atLiyue Harbor, the two just arrive in time for the ceremony. AsNingguangsummons Rex Lapis, he appears dead before the entire crowd. She orders theMillelithto apprehend all suspects, the Traveler included because they aren't from Liyue and they were too close to the center. The Traveler attempts to sneak out of the area, but on the way, accidentally steps on some glass and alerts the Millelith of their presence. A group of Millelith soon surround the Traveler, who draws their sword out. Before they can fight, ayoung Hydro userdefeats them. Taking them to safety, the young man introduces himself as "Childe", and asks if they metSignorainMondstadt. The two realize that Childe is also one of theHarbingersand become wary of him, but Childe insists that he is not here to fight and that he will tell them more when they arrive atNorthland Bank.
Upon making their way to the bank, Childe tells them in order to clear their name, they have to get the word of theadeptibefore the Millieth does, who are rumored to live atJueyun Karst. He gives them asigilto prevent the adepti from harming them if they become hostile.
At Jueyun Karst, the pair meet with theMoon Carver, who notices their sigil and asks what they are doing in the area. The Millelith then arrive, prompting the Moon Carver to ask the Traveler to remove them so they can continue speaking. With the guards routed, the Traveler explains that Rex Lapis was assassinated, much to the adepti's rage. Knowing that the Traveler is innocent of the crimes that the Millelith have accused them of, it tells them to seek out theCloud RetainerandMountain Shaperand theDemon Conqueror; the former two residing around Jueyun, and the latter inWangshu Inn.
The "Demon Conqueror" the Moon Carver was referring to is a young man named Xiao, who appears to be irritated by their presence and leaves. Speaking to the inn's boss,Verr Goldet, she tells them that Xiao is actually an adepti and enjoysAlmond Tofu, leaving the other dish up to them, which they decide to make aSatisfying Salad. She suggests they speak to thecheffor the special Almond Tofu. The chef however, is too terrified to create the dish, as a ghost has been haunting the inn. As the pair investigate, Paimon spots the ghost, terrifying the chef even further. With Goldet's advice, the pair follow the ghost, who ends up possessing a decrepitRuin Hunter. After defeating the Ruin Hunter, the ghost promises to stop haunting the inn if the Traveler continues to play with her. Upon telling the chef of the ghost's promise, he is relieved and creates some Almond Tofu for them.
With the tofu and salad on hand, they catch up to Xiao. They manage to stop him from leaving by offering him their food, and then tell him about Rex's death, which shocks him. At Paimon's request, he explains to them that the ghost is an innocent spirit who could not move on, so he asked the innkeeper and boss to take care of her for the time being.
With one of the three adepti found, the Traveler and Paimon begin their search for the Mountain Shaper. Arriving onMt. Hulao, they find amanbegging the adepti to give mercy to him and hisbrother. Mistaking the two for adepti messengers, he explains to them that they were going up the mountain when his brother became encased in amber. They find his brother and free him from the amber. The Mountain Shaper then appears, angered at the Traveler for freeing a "thief" and disturbing its mountain. Showing it the sigil, it then questions them to their presence and learns from them about Rex's death. It also explains to them that it planted many karst flowers to keep the mountain's tranquility, seeing everyone else as thieves and that those who stepped on the flowers would be encased in amber.
With the second adepti found, the Cloud Retainer is the last one to be found. Arriving atMt. Aocang, they find a stone table with food remains, which is meant to be food offered to the adepti. Looking around the area, they place some deliciousMatsutake Meat Rolls,Jewelry SoupandMora Meaton the stone table. Cloud Retainer allows them to enter its residence for the offerings, but will only meet them if they can navigate its domain. They are able to solve the puzzles and meet Cloud Retainer, upon which they explain about Rex's death to it. Cloud Retainer becomes enraged and vows to destroy Liyue for their crimes, but the Traveler manages to calm it down by countering with a "contract" of sorts with the food they had offered it, which it reluctantly accepts.
Now with all three adepti found, the Traveler returns to Childe and informs them of all that had transpired, who in turn tells them that the Liyue Qixing are refusing to let anyone see Rex's body. Paimon accidentally blurts out that they came to visit The Seven, which Childe immediately takes note of. He tells them that he can help them, but it will be some time in order to meet with his contact.

After returning fromJueyun Karst, theTravelerandPaimonreturn to theNorthland Bankand informedChildeof the adepti. Childe in turn tells them that theLiyue Qixinghave hidden theExuvia, but he has a contact that can get them in.Ekaterinatells them that he is waiting for them atLiuli Pavilion.
Arriving at the restaurant, Childe introduces the two toZhongli, a consultant of theWangsheng Funeral Parlor. Zhongli states that it is his duty to give Rex Lapis a proper farewell, as the adepti are slowly distancing themselves from the rise of mankind. Because of this role, he is capable of bringing the Traveler to the Exuvia. Although suspicious of Childe's intentions, he does not pry further and states that they must go to buy the needed funeral items, the first one being someNoctilucous Jade, having been provided themorafrom Childe.
The three visit theJade Mysteryand inspectShitou's samples. Although they only needed one sample of jade, Zhongli inexplicably tries to buy all three. However, Paimon stops him and suggests to re-evaluate the purchase. Zhongli is not bothered, but reveals to them how he can tell high-quality jade based on theirPyroaffinity. Returning to Shitou, he reluctantly chips off a small sample from all three of his jade. Although the samples are paper-thin, Zhongli states that they can always reinforce the interior withHydro. The Traveler recalls the massive cooking pot from the Meaty Tribe inDadaupa Gorge. The three travel there and use the cooking pot to test the jade samples, fending off the angry tribe due to ruining their food.
With the third sample proving to be of the highest quality, the three return to Shitou and buy the third jade from him. Shitou then inquires as to why they are buying the jade, upon which Zhongli explains to him of Rex's passing. Saddened by the Geo Archon's death, Shitou sells the jade to them at half price, which the Traveler pays off. They then leave the jade for the jewelsmith to forge.
The next items on Zhongli's list are some perfumes which are created from flowers. They meet withBolaiand ask for someSilk Flowers. Unsurprisingly, Zhongli does not have any mora on him, but after learning why they are buying the flowers, Bolai gives the flowers to them for free. However, he has no idea how to create the perfume, so he suggests speaking to some women around the city for advice, culminating with the Traveler making some withYing'er's assistance. With all three perfumes on hand, they return to Zhongli and offer the perfumes to theStatue of The Sevenoutside the harbor.
Zhongli then tells them that he needs theCleansing BellfromMadame Ping, but refuses to go with them under the pretense of having some business to attend to. They find Madame Ping in Yujing Terrace, who tells them that the bell is inside her teapot, which is actually a domain, making them realize that she is one of the adepti. They recover the bell and return to Zhongli.
With the rite nearing completion, Zhongli heads toGranny Shanand takes the kites he had commissioned. Granny Shan is one of the few who appear to care for Liyue's old traditions and appreciates Zhongli's compliments on how well the kites are made. Zhongli now needs some extra work done, so Childe gives the Traveler a bag of mora to get the needed workers. They negotiate withTic,TacandToeto get the requested services, before returning to Childe. Childe allows them to keep the remaining mora in exchange for some information, offering to leave the vaults at the Northland Bank open in return. Before Paimon could answer, the Traveler reflexively refuses to help him, which upsets Childe. Zhongli then walks in, unaware of the conversation, and states that they need to get someEverlasting IncensefromBubu Pharmacy.
Arriving at the pharmacy, they are greeted byQiqi. Learning that they want some Everlasting Incense, she requests their prescription, but they are not using it for medicinal purposes. Qiqi appears to be unaware of the Geo Archon's passing, stating that she will give them some if they help her hunt a cocogoat, which they'll need to use theGuizhong Ballistain order to do so. The three head toMt. Tianhengand find the disabled ballista. Zhongli recalls that there was a supply post nearby with spare parts, which they raid to repair the ballista. Doing so causes someTreasure Hoardersto attack the group, as they had disabled it in order to loot the surrounding area. They defeat the bandits but soon realize that there is no cocogoat, as the ballista would have detected it.
Returning to the pharmacy, they tell Qiqi that there is no cocogoat. She then takes out her notebook and realizes that she meant coconut milk, and the Traveler begins explaining how coconut milk is created. A man then appears and thanks them for taking care of Qiqi. Introducing himself asBaizhu, he learns that they want some Everlasting Incense and offers to sell it for three million mora, which they can't afford. The Traveler is forced to go to Childe for aid, who is amused by the story and agrees to pay for the incense and set up a supply of coconut milk for the pharmacy. As the group talks, Childe excuses himself and asks Ekaterina if she had heard of anything useful. She tells him that the Qixing have hidden the Exuvia at the Golden House.
Zhongli asks the Traveler about their opinion collecting the materials for the rite. Regardless of their response, he tells them to meet him at theThird-Round Knockout, a hole-in-the-wall tavern and he has brought mora to pay for the expenses. Arriving at the tavern,Iron Tongue Tiantells them a story aboutNingguangjust as a young woman appears, having found the Traveler. The woman introduces herself asGanyuand that Ningguang has extended them an invitation to the Jade Chamber. Zhongli tells them to go, as such invitations are rare, and that he'll be waiting for them atDihua Marshwhen their business with Ningguang is done.

Having received an invitation fromNingguangto theJade Chamberthrough theLiyue Qixing's emissary,Ganyu, theTravelerandPaimonsearch for a way there atMt. Tianheng. They initially find a mechanism and use it, but it does not take them as far as they expected. The Traveler then remembers theGuizhong BallistathatZhonglihad repaired while hunting for the non-existent cocogoat. Arriving at the ruins, they find theMillelithstanding guard outside. Paimon panics and believes that Ningguang had lured them into a trap, causing a fight.
The Traveler defeats the Millelith just as a young woman approaches and asks what is going on. Learning that the two "had designs" on the ballista, the Traveler tells her that they were looking for a way to the Jade Chamber. The woman then introduces herself asKeqingand realizes that they are Ningguang's guests. She tells them that the Millelith are here because someone had magically repaired the ballista in a single day, when it had been standing in disrepair for a long time. Keqing explains how to access the Jade Chamber and departs.
Paimon then remembers that they still need to give a gift to Ningguang per tradition, and suggests making a tasty slime snack. The Traveler obtains the ingredients and saves amanfromTreasure Hoarders. Grateful for the rescue, he sends word back to his boss to allow them to take some items for free. With a gift now in hand, they head to Yuehai Pavilion to ascend to the Jade Chamber, where they are greeted by Ningguang. She gracefully accepts Paimon's gift and offers one in return, before speaking at length about various subjects, including deities, archons, and theFatui. Paimon suggests looking at the board and finds a special paper, heading to some ruins where they find evidence that the Fatui were researching the Sigils of Permission.
With the business at the Jade Palace wrapped up, they meet up with Zhongli atDihua Marshto continue preparing for the Rite of Parting. Zhongli tells them that they need wildGlaze Lilies. While searching for the flowers, they encounter Ganyu again and discover that she is one of the adepti, having watched over Liyue Harbor since its inception 3,700 years ago. After hearing her thoughts aboutRex Lapis' passing, they return to Liyue Harbor, only to find it in chaos.
The adepti and Qixing have finally confronted each other directly, and at the same time, Ningguang has started cracking down on the Fatui. Zhongli learns fromFelixthat the Millelith have begun questioning theWangsheng Funeral Parlordue to their ties with the Fatui, prompting Zhongli to leave the Traveler to assistHu Tao, but not before telling them to look forChilde.
Realizing he must have gone to theGolden Housein pursuit of theExuvia's corpse and theGnosisamidst the chaos, the Traveler heads there and duels him. During the battle, Childe manages to get close to the Exuvia and plunges his hand into its chest, only to come up empty-handed. Childe mistakenly believes they have the Gnosis and demands they relinquish it to him; as the Traveler does not have it, he take it as a refusal and prepares to fight them. During the fight, the Traveler manages to force him to unleash hisDelusionand then hisFoul Legacy Transformationtechnique. Despite his advantages, he is ultimately bested and returns to normal. He remarks on how he only realized just now it was impossible for them to have the Gnosis and howSignora's report on them was completely off, but does not inquire into the latter further.
Switching to his backup plan, despite his distaste for it due to involving innocent bystanders, Childe releases the Sigils of Permission the Fatui replicated to summonOsial, an ancient god that Rex Lapis had sealed underneathGuyun Stone Forest. In the face of this new threat, the adepti and Qixing put aside their differences to fight the common enemy.
To fight Osial, the group uses Guizhong Ballistas replicated by Ningguang, with Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper and Moon Carver manning them. As they do so, portals open and release Fatui subordinates onto the platform, intent on destroying the ballistas. Keqing leads the Millelith, while the Traveler is blessed by Xiao, Ganyu and Madame Ping. They manage to repel the Fatui assault, upon which the three adepti on the ballistas fire a powerful shot at Osial, but it does not flinch and destroys them and the platform in retaliation. Xiao narrowly saves the Traveler in the process. With no other choice, Ningguang decides to sacrifice her Jade Chamber, using its massive weight to crush the ancient god into the bottom of the ocean.
With the threat dealt with, the adepti and Qixing settle their differences and the Rite of Parting proceeds as planned. However, this still leaves one question; whereisthe Geo Archon? The Traveler seeks out Zhongli and finds him atNorthland Bank, speaking to none other than Signora and Childe. He reveals himself as not only the Geo Archon but also the one who instigated the entire series of events, starting with his supposed assassination at the Rite of Descension, as a test to see whether Liyue could continue without him. In exchange for a yet-unknown ultimate goal, he forged the "contract to end all contracts" with theTsaritsa; satisfied with the outcome, he hands his Gnosis to Signora. The two Harbingers and former Archon soon leave the bank.
Sometime later, the Qixing host the Rite of Parting, which the Traveler attends as they overhear rumors about the battle against Osial, the Fatui's involvement, and hears the official story the Qixing came up with to explain Morax's demise. Keqing, grateful for the Traveler's assistance in stopping Osial, asks them what they would like as a reward; to her surprise, they simply ask to help put up missing posters for theirmissing sibling. After talking to several attendees, they speak to Zhongli about Liyue's future. Zhongli, aware of the Traveler's plans, tells them that the next nation,Inazuma, has been sealed off and its archon,"Baal", has issued aVision Hunt Decree, surmising that his "death" will cause her to advance her plans even further. He tells the Traveler that although the nation may be shut off for the time being, they should not give up and try to find a way in.

After theirbrief travelwithDainsleif, the Traveler and Paimon head to theAdventurers' GuildLiyuebranch, where they findGanyuandLan. Ganyu explains that theTreasure Hoardersare attempting a heist on theAbyss Orderand came to the Guild to post a commission as the Qixing are too busy, so the Traveler accepts it.
Heading to the ruins, they make their way inside and find aDefiled Statueof Barbatos hanging upside down, along with the deceasedGrand Thief. The area starts shaking soon after, causing Paimon to panic and tell the Traveler to flee. As they near the end, anAbyss Heraldintercepts them. After a brief scuffle, the Herald teleports away.
Outside the ruins, they find Dainsleif, who is surprised to see them. The Traveler then tells him about the inverted statue and the deceased thief. Dainsleif had never heard of an inverted statue before, but due to the Traveler's description of it, knows that it is tied to the Abyss Order in some way. He then proposes to catch up to the Abyss Order, so they find several groups aroundJueyun Karst. After defeating them, Dainsleif begins talking aboutKhaenri'ah, upon which part of the Traveler's memory regarding the fallen nation returns.
Dainsleif talks more about Khaenri'ah, explaining that it was a nation without gods; not because they were killed, or that they abandoned it, but because it never had one in the first place; human civilization flourished at a very advanced pace; but around five centuries ago, that nation was destroyed by gods. Dainsleif reveals that theRuin Guardsare just the modern names: they were originally called Field Tillers, powerful mortal weapons, and after the destruction of Khaenri'ah they wandered aimlessly spreading throughout all of Teyvat.
After defeating moreAbyss Mages, they find a talisman, which Dainsleif begins to translate. It is revealed that the first phase of the Abyss Order's plan is aboutOsial, who the Traveler had fought along with theLiyue Qixingand theadeptia while ago. The Abyss Order is planning to attach Osial's limbs to the Defiled Statue, and use the eye of the first Field Tiller in place of the orb that the Statues of The Seven normally hold, to construct a mechanized god.
The Traveler then suggests heading to theFavonius Cathedralto get some information. Dainsleif agrees, but reminds the Traveler not to speak of the missing statue, and he waits outside. Inside, the Traveler finds Barbara, who tells them that they did indeed have one of their statues missing. She also tells them about the "Tyrant's Final Fury", a strange phenomenon in that people who approached Old Mondstadt were attacked by missiles for about a year before they stopped.
Rosariathen comes in and informs the pair that the Abyss Order is attackingWolvendom. The Traveler informs Dainsleif of this and they make their way there, where he insists they find Boreas and ask for more information. Arriving at the site where they first met Boreas, they find the Herald once more subjecting him to a corrupting ritual. The Traveler interrupts the ritual and the Herald flees once more.
Boreas and Razor thank them for the timely rescue. The Traveler then asks Boreas about the Field Tiller. Boreas is not interested in the name, but does tell them that a strange machine entered his territory long ago. Taking the intruder as a challenge, he fought and damaged the machine, which fled the area soon after.
The Traveler and Paimon return to Dainsleif and inform them of Boreas' account. With his and Barbara's information, they conclude that the Field Tiller is the machine tied to the Tyrant's Final Fury. Paimon then realizes that it must be theWeird StatueinStormterror's Lair.
Arriving at the domed building, they find the Field Tiller and Dainsleif concludes that it is the one the Abyss Order is seeking. Using his own methods, he extracts its eye out and takes custody of it. To ensure that the Abyss Order cannot restart their plan, he also suggests to destroy the Defiled Statue.
Returning to the ruins once more, Dainsleif senses the Herald, who attacks them with some mages. As the Herald clashes with the Traveler, it realizes that they are too strong and tries to flee in another portal, but is stopped by Dainsleif, who uses magic to put it into a chokehold. However, he is stopped by a shockwave from someone's sword.
When the smoke clears out, the Traveler is shocked because the person who interrupted the attack is none other than theirsibling. The sibling asks the Traveler why they are with Dainsleif; surprisingly enough, Dainsleif also knows them. The sibling reveals that Dainsleif is the Twilight Sword, one of the royal guards from Khaenri'ah, and he had failed to protect it, being laid upon a curse of immortality and forced to watch his people turn into monsters.
Although the Traveler insists that the sibling go home with them together, the sibling refuses because they have to fulfill the goal of the Abyss Order, or their war with destiny will not end. They tell them that they will see the truth about the world in their travels, which they had already done. As the Herald conjures a portal, the sibling leaves alongside them. Dainsleif dashes into the portal, with the Traveler trying to follow suit, but it closes on them before they could enter, leaving them depressed.
As they try to not be depressed about the events, Paimon cheers them back up, telling them that they have some useful information and that they need to keep in mind about Dainsleif as they prepare to go forInazuma. They recount the events happened so far, and Paimon tells the Traveler to prove their sibling what they're made of and the resolve to travel around Teyvat to discover the truth.

Arriving atWolvendom, the Traveler andPaimonexplored the area and are immediately attacked by someslimes. They fend some off, but another group of slimes comes in, one of which grows to considerable size. As the Traveler and large slime charge at each other, a boy comes in and cuts the slime back down to size, prompting the slimes to flee. Introducing himself asRazor, he want them to help him find some raw meat as his intervention has ruined his wolf pack's hunt. The Traveler finds some raw meat and gives it to Razor. Although it is not enough for his pack, he considers it to be better than nothing, which the "red burny girl" often does, who the Traveler mistakes forAmber.
AtMondstadt's front gate, the Traveler finds Amber and asks if they met Razor before. Amber does not know who they are talking about, but asks them to accompany her for an investigation as she has heard reports of wolf attacks atDrunkard GorgeandSpringvale. Upon investigating for clues, they find fur from different wolves, but also find a strayWolfhookseed that indicates the attackers came from Wolvendom. Amber tells the people of Springvale to remain calm as she investigates, but the younger generation refuses to stand by and do nothing.
Returning to the wilderness, Amber meets Razor for the first time. Razor states that Amber is not the girl he had talked about, but nonetheless accepts her aid. He asks them to help, smelling blood, causing Amber to be concerned about the villagers' safety. Razor's lack of social skills initially makes Amber believe that his pack had attacked the village. He leads them to an injured wolf and when Amber states that it doesn't prove that his pack is innocent, Razor tells her that another wolf packfrom outside, led by a black wolf, had been attacking the villages.
Venturing deeper into Wolvendom, Razor tells the Traveler to collect some Wolfhook seeds to tend to the injured wolf, while he answers Amber's questions. The Traveler returns with the seeds just as the Springvale villagers come and accuse Razor of orchestrating the wolf attacks.Boreas, the Wolf of the North, is enraged by the disturbance and orders Razor to fight him to prove his worth for protecting outsiders. With the Traveler's aid, Razor is able to calm Boreas down, who confirms that an outside wolf pack had been causing the problems. Boreas states that the foreign pack would pay for their actions, but Razor cannot intervene, as he is ultimately human and not wolf. Seeing the Traveler's worth, Boreas also allows them tospar with himas he departs from the scene.
Razor is upset that he cannot help his wolf pack and Boreas' words have caused him to question his identity. Amber offers to bring him to Mondstadt for his safety. Razor rejects the offer and thanks the three for their help, jokingly forgetting Amber's name, much to her disdain.

Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leavesis the prologue act inChapter IIof theArchon Quests.
While overlookingLiyue Harbor, theTravelertakes a moment to stop and think over the recent revelations abouttheir siblingand theAbyss Order.Paimoncomforts and encourages them to keep going, and the Traveler regains their resolve to look for and confront theUnknown Godand demand answers. They try to brainstorm over ways to get to their next destination,Inazuma, when they remember the one person they've met who is Inazuman â€”Atsuko.
They head back to the harbor to ask Atsuko how to get into Inazuma. While she is able to give them an answer, she also warns them of the danger of the trip. She explains that the storm is not the only thing to worry about, as they will also have to worry about thestrict isolationist policiesand the authorities who will be hot on their trail if they're discovered. When the Traveler refuses to be swayed by her warnings, she relents and refers them toBeidou, who may know how to break through the storm owing to her vast experience on the seas. Wasting no time, the Traveler heads toGuyun Stone Forestwhere theAlcor,The CruxFleet's flagship, is anchored.
Arriving at the ship, they find Beidou with anunknown man. Beidou recognizes the Traveler, having heard of their exploits fromNingguangand introduces the man as Kazuha, a temporary crewmember. She mistakenly assumes that the Traveler has approached her to join "The Crux Clash," a Vision-less martial arts tournament she holds for renowned fighters. When Paimon explains they're not there for the tournament, she tries to encourage them to join anyway by revealing that the prize for this tournament is aMasterless Visionprovided by Kazuha, who hopes that the tournament winner will be able to reawaken it. However, the Traveler is not interested in the Vision, and is only looking for a way to get to Inazuma. Hearing that, Beidou changes gears and decides to change the prize â€” if the Traveler wins the tournament, they will be able to choose between two prizes, the Masterless Vision or a ride to Inazuma on theAlcor. The Traveler finally agrees, and heads to the arena to sign up.
At the arena, Paimon suggests they scope out their initial competition before signing up. However, after speaking to a few other contestants, they realize they won't have much competition. With newfound confidence, they head to the desk where a member of the crew,Zhuhan, is in charge of registering the combatants. She is shocked to see the traveler who helped Liyue fight off anancient godjoining the tournament, gathering attention from the other competitors and spectators. After proving that they don't have a Vision and listing a few of their achievements so far for the sake of formality, the Traveler is finally registered and ready to fight the first round.
The first opponent,Jinyou, is easily no match for the Traveler, even without the use of their elemental powers. Beidou, impressed with their skills, states that since putting them in, more people are coming to join, hoping to face off against them. She decides to put them straight through to the semi-finals so that they don't need to waste their energy on fights well below their skill level.
The next opponent,Rongshi, is more of a challenge and the Traveler barely prevails against him. After he's defeated, Rongshi explains that he had no interest in the prize, and instead joined to pit himself against other strong fighters. He humbly accepts his defeat and even asks the Traveler to spar with him again in the future.
Rongshi is unable to tell them much about their next opponent other than that they are fast and nimble, so they decide to ask around. Unfortunately, they don't learn much and decide to go to Beidou for more information. Beidou only reiterates their opponent's speed, but Kazuha offers to give them more information if they follow him to a quieter place to talk.
Once there, Kazuha reveals that he already knows about the Traveler's ability to harness the power of the elements without a Vision. As the Traveler is unable to answer his questions about how he is able to do so, he instead tests their skills by having them fight someSlimes. After the fight, Kazuha assures them that their opponent's speed will stand no chance against their skill, and gives them more tips about their opponent's fighting style. After telling them a bit more about Inazuma and theElectro Archon, they go back to the arena to await the final match.
At the arena, the final match is about to start, but the challenger is a no-show, much to Beidou's irritation. Kazuha then senses something is wrong and the group checks on the box displaying the Vision, only to discover it missing. He offers to look for it since it was his responsibility. The Traveler accompanies him and Kazuha reveals that he knows where the culprit is going and who they are.
The culprit isFei the Flyer, aTreasure Hoarder, who is surprised they managed to track him. He reveals that he signed up at the tournament and had intended to win fair and square, but after seeing the Traveler defeat Rongshi, he knew he had no chance in beating them. Initially refusing to hand the Vision, he fights them, only to be bested. Kazuha threatens to kill Fei, but after nothing happens, he changes his mind and lets the Treasure Hoarder leave, confiscating the Vision.
Kazuha reveals that he had been aware of the theft all along and hoped that Fei would have been able to resonate with the Vision, as the gods typically grant them to those who prove great strength and resilience. He then asks the Traveler to do so, but they are unable to either, so Kazuha hangs onto it. Paimon asks him why he is so obsessed with the Vision, and Kazuha reveals that when the Raiden Shogun enacted theVision Hunt Decree,his friend, another Vision bearer, challenged her, only to die in the ensuing duel. Kazuha, who had just arrived and witnessed the final moments of the duel, snatched the Vision and fled from his pursuers, hoping to keep the hope alive that his friend had. He had heard rumors of Masterless Visions reawakening in his travels, and as such, was looking for someone to do so.
Returning to the arena, the two learn from Zhuhan that Beidou was summoned by Ningguang regarding the tournament, and is filled in on the details by Kazuha. By default, Fei is disqualified and the Traveler is crowned the champion. Kazuha warns the Traveler that the journey to Inazuma will be treacherous, even more so once they set foot in the closed nation. He also tells them that theAlcorneeds to resupply for the trip and that they will be notified once ready; in the meantime, he intends to travel across Liyue to see if someone can reawaken the Vision, hoping the two of them will have enjoy their journeys.

Wondering on the status of theAlcor, theTravelerandPaimonhead toKatheryneatLiyue's guild branch. And just then,Sea Drakearrives, having been sent byBeidouto tell them that they are ready to set sail. Katheryne says her farewells, but tells them that she would be waiting for them atNarukami Island.
Beidou disembarks with the Traveler and Paimon atRitoubefore being greeted byThoma, her business partner. The Captain leaves the pair to his care since she can't stay around for too long withKazuhaon board, who is still a wanted fugitive. Thoma later helps them pass the processing center to avoid suspicion given the impossible request and the ridiculous amount ofMora.
After processing, Thoma explains that there are some inspectors who try to increase the price of processing as much as possible for outlanders, who cannot leave the nation due to theSakoku Decree. As such, the foreigners formed theInternational Trade Associationto survive. He also learns they intend to meet with theRaiden Shogun, stating that he can help them do so, but in turn they will need to help out others first, starting with the said association.
Thoma's friend and the President of the Trade Association,Kurisu, is surprised to see new outlanders, and explains that since he and the foreigners have been stuck in the port, the Kanjou Commission has been bleeding them dry with absurd taxes. They originally had to pay Mora, but they suddenly changed it toCrystal Marrow, which almost none of association had heard of. Even worse, their attempts to look for it cause the item to skyrocket in both taxes and price from the only source available, leaving them in danger of homelessness. The Traveler offers to assist, with Kurisu accepting as they aren't affiliated and as a newcomer, the vendor might drop his guard.
The merchant,Werner, realizes they were sent by the association and refuses to negotiate. Returning to Thoma, he tells them that Werner hails fromMondstadtand found a "patron" after leaving the association. Giving an item from both Mondstadt and Liyue, the vendor gives in to his emotions and admits that he is playing a scheme byKeijirouand his companions; they buy all of the Crystal Marrow and give it to him, who sells the excess back to the association at profit and the cycle repeats; despite his role in the plot, he is barely paid. Tracking him down, they spot Keijirou burying a ledger. Werner tells them to send it to Kurisu, as he is too afraid to confront the President.
Keijirou demands payment from the association when the Traveler and Paimon arrive and expose his wrongdoings. Cornered, the corrupt officer offers to give his spare Marrows to keep the case quiet, butHarrison, angered at the injustice, demands more and calls thecommissionerby name, prompting a passingKatsuieto order the merchants arrested. Before that could happen, Thoma intervenes and hands them a card from theYashiro Commissionand displays a peculiar ornate fan, making Katsuie decide to drop the incident to avoid having a problem with "her".
Taking them aside, Thoma explains that he is actually an attendant of the Kamisato Clan, taking care of the clan's eldest daughter,Kamisato Ayaka, the Shirasagi Himegimi. Ayaka has heard of their feats and is expecting their arrival, hoping that they can change the tides â€” theVision Hunt Decree. Although the Traveler is uninterested in helping, insistent on pursuing their goal, Thoma agrees to help them meet the Electro Archon anyway and ask to meet him atKomore Teahouse. After he leaves, the pair remembers that they still can't leave Ritou, but as Thoma was unlikely to have forgotten that, they believe it must be part of the test.
Since they still need atravel permitto leave Ritou, Paimon suggests they head to the Kanjou office to meet with the Commissioner,Hiiragi Shinsuke. Upon arriving at his residence, he walks out and notices the Traveler. Hiiragi agrees to help but only after the Traveler agrees to complete an unbearable request; the Traveler initially is flabbergasted and finds it too strenuous, but after spotting a woman behind Hiiragi who silently nods her head, the Traveler agrees to think about it.
Leaving the office, they secretly receive a letter through a bodyguard fromMiss Hiiragiasking to meet late at night. Chisato asks them to deliver a letter toKujou Kamajiof theTenryou Commissionand reveals that a few days before their arrival, anarrogant-sounding womanarrived and conspired with her father to keep the Traveler on Ritou. The following day, she heads to a supply convoy and uses her position to force the two escort guards to accept the Traveler as her bodyguard. On the way, they fight off bandits, and arriving at the destination, Chisato returns to Ritou, wishing them luck and reminding them to bring the letter to Kamaji for their permit.
Arriving at the teahouse, the pair are greeted by Thoma inside, who pulls a prank on them by pretending to be the dogTaroumaru. Thoma apologizes for the test, as it was necessary, if they can "change the lightning." Thoma promises to bring them to the Kamisato residence after they visit theStatue of the Omnipresent God, still under construction.
There, Thoma explains about how the Raiden Shogun declared the Vision Hunt Decree and that the "gems" embedded on the statue are the seized Visions. The Traveler touches the statue and suffers a headache as they hear the aspirations of the Visions' owners, surprising Thoma and Paimon. Later at the Kamisato residence, Ayaka greets them while concealed on the other side of a screen, having anticipated their arrival. She hopes that the Traveler would assist in the fight against the Shogun, but they again refuse. Having been informed already by Thoma, Ayaka is not surprised and so compromises with them, promising to bring them to the Shogun if they visit three people who had their Vision confiscated from them.
At the first location,Konda Village, the Traveler finds an old couple,MahiruandKenjiroutrying to persuade a younger manTejimanot to leave. Inquiring the man, Tejima was a samurai who become Visionless. With his Vision gone, he has had trouble remembering why he stayed at the village for so long and is intending to leave and become a wandering samurai. The pair offer to help refresh his memory, which he accepts. They find a paper that explains why he stayed at the village; to wait for his lover, but she never came. After the events, Tejima then chooses to remain in the village to wait for her, although wondering if she would ever come.
The next person is a samurai of the Tenryou Commission who had their Vision confiscated, found inInazuma City. As Paimon wonders why the Shogunate would take action against one of their own, they hear a commotion breaking out. Two men are accusing a samurai,Kurosawa Kyounosuke, of withholding emergency rations from them. He had originally given it to them on request, but now is withholding them for no reason.
Speaking to the samurai, he tells them that despite enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree, he was told that he had been "slacking off" to the point that he even disappointed the Raiden Shogun, causing him to lose his Vision. He had forgotten what he had done every month, and is not even aware of the rations themselves. Just recently, he was pursuing some Treasure Hoarders when the men had stopped him and asks the Traveler to track them down, believing they would have stolen the rations.
They find the Treasure Hoarders nearby, who are commenting over their recent plunders. After beating them up,Tadaotries to recruit them, but the Traveler refuses and inquires about Kurosawa. Tadao states that Kurosawa's house had nothing apart from a box, which he offers in return for his and his men's freedom. Opening the box, they are surprised to find that it only contains IOUs, all addressed to a MissAoiofTsukumomono Groceries, and the Hoarder gang leaves.
Heading to Aoi, she tells them that Kurosawa always bought foodstuffs regularly from her store to give to the people, even taking on debt to ensure their well-being. She also recalls that he has a prized sword which she would have gladly accepted as payment for his debts, but he had declined. Returning to Kurosawa once more, he learns the truth and explains the history of his sword to them. He also threatened the rioting men with his sword, even though he felt himself unable to go through with the act, and is troubled that he cannot be good or bad, wondering what to do.
With the second person dealt with, they head to the final client, a swordmaster known for the Meikyou Shisui Art who is also in the city. Outside the dojo, they find two disciples worried about their sensei's well-being. The Traveler make a ruse that they had come to learn from their master seeing that the disciples were wary beyond reason.Junyaapologizes, stating that with all the trouble recently, he is on high alert. Their sensei,Domon, is believed to be possessed and is recovering, explaining his history and that he took a turn for the worse when his Vision was taken. As such, they have hired shrine maidens from theGrand Narukami Shrineto exorcise the demon possessing him.
While the exorcism is in motion, Paimon spots a suspicious person nearby and the Traveler pursues them. The man is surprised they caught up so fast, believing Domon had improved their skills in the past few years. He reveals himself to beAnzai, the oldest disciple of his sensei in the art until Domon surpassed both him and their master. When he heard Domon had lost his mind, he came back to see if the rumors were true â€” to his surprise, Domon called out for him. He then tells them to head back to the dojo as he suspects the ritual is about to end.
The exorcism has ended, but the maiden,Inagi Hotomi, had not sensed any demon possessing Domon. However, she is unsure if another form of demon has possessed him, and tells them thatLady Yaehas taken notice of the unusual case. She tells them to come to the shrine tomorrow and leaves. At the shrine, Yae inspects Domon and states that he is not possessed, much to the disciples' surprise. The Vision gave Domon immense aspirations, and when it was seized, the gruesome fact that he had destroyed the aspirations of his past deeds, rushed back into him, turning him maniacal. Anzai then walks in, much to Domon's surprise and tells him that he had accepted the fact that his aspirations were gone and had "passed" them to Domon. Now that Domon's aspirations are gone, he urges them to pass it to his disciples, who are still willing to learn from him. Domon eventually realizes the meaning behind Anzai's words and promises to, thanking Yae for her help with his disciples before leaving.
Yae then speaks with the Traveler, having anticipated their arrival, albeit premature â€” nonetheless, she mysteriously states that she has high expectations for them and they better not disappoint her. Paimon then suggests they return to Ayaka.
Ayaka introduces herself in person this time and explains the reasoning to why she sent them to three former Vision bearers â€” having seen the suffering firsthand, the Traveler finally agrees to help. Heading to the teahouse, Ayaka explains about the resistance's actions. One of their operations, creating fake Visions, was halted when the craftsman responsible for making them,Master Masakatsu, had been arrested. Ayaka wishes to break him out, but cannot risk either herself or Thoma to lead the operation â€” therefore, the Traveler would do the job. She states that there will be more people willing to help and sends them to theNaganohara Fireworks.
There, they find members of the Tenryou Commission threaten a Vision bearer. Before the Traveler could intervene, a young woman grabs their attention. Paimon scolds her for not letting interfere as the samurai take the Vision, but minutes later learn that the samurai had been fooled by a ruse, as the Vision bearer thanks her for passing along the fake that was just confiscated. The woman,Yoimiya, is known throughout Inazuma for her fireworks â€” despite this, she was not exempt but managed to elude confiscation of her own Vision due to Masakatsu's craftsmanship. Yoimiya learns from Paimon that the two were sent by Ayaka to break Masakatsu out.
Arriving at the police station, the Traveler and Yoimiya enter through a backdoor, upon which she leaves them to finish her "gift". The three eventually arrive at the main holding cell where the guards are torturing Masakatsu. But before they can do anything,Kujou Saracomes in, checks on Masakatsu and then reprimands the guards for torture. She soon hears Yoimiya's footsteps and orders the guards to investigate. Yoimiya then sets off her "gift" to distract the guards as they rescue Masakatsu. Sara then spots them in the act but allows them to leave as Masakatsu needs urgent care, but warns the craftsman that she'll bring him back in when he's recovered.
Yoimiya and Masakatsu thank the Traveler and Paimon, who then return to the teahouse to inform Ayaka of the good news. Thoma also states that the Tenryou Commission has been tasked with a "ceremony" of sorts and suggests they spend the next few days relaxing, which Ayaka accepts. After having ahot pot "game", the group separates.

TheTravelerandPaimonreturn toKomore Teahouseto learn about their next operation withKamisato AyakaandThoma. However, they discover that Thoma is not present, with Ayaka arriving shortly after with news that theTenryou Commissionhas taken him to theStatue of the Omnipresent Godto become the one hundredth victim of theVision Hunt Decree, which will be commemorated by a public ceremony where theRaiden Shogunwill make a personal appearance. With hardly any time left before the ceremony begins, Ayaka is willing to storm in alone to rescue her friend. However, the Traveler and Paimon remind her that she cannot personally intervene without endangering the neutrality of the entireYashiro Commission, and convince her to let them rescue Thoma instead.
After witnessing the Traveler use Electro powers without aVision, the Raiden Shogun steps in, declaring the Traveler to be "an exception," which she deems to be "the enemy of eternity." Brandishing her might, the Raiden Shogun pulls the Traveler into an alternate dimension. The Traveler proves no match for the Raiden Shogun and is quickly incapacitated. Before she can finish them off, Thoma distracts her and escapes with the Traveler and Paimon. The Raiden Shogun orders the Traveler's arrest, vowing to "strike twice" next time.
Now wanted criminals, Thoma tells the Traveler and Paimon to take refuge with theWatatsumi Army, which is leading a resistance against the Vision Hunt Decree, while he takes refuge in Komore Teahouse, safely within Yashiro Commission territory. Because the Resistance's whereabouts are secret, the Traveler has to find it themselves. While making their way westwards into the warzone, the Traveler and Paimon come across a lone Resistance soldier namedTeppeisurrounded by Shogunate troops. They rescue him and he readily agrees to take them to meet GeneralGorou, the Resistance's commanding officer. However, he warns them that the Resistance is at a disadvantage, as theShogun's Armyhas the powerfulKujou Sara's leadership.
During their meeting with Gorou, the Traveler impresses him with their feats at the Vision Hunt Ceremony, and they are readily welcomed into the Resistance. Gorou has Teppei show them around the camp, and the Traveler helps a few soldiers they meet. A sudden attack by the Shogun's Army leads Teppei to suspect that there is a traitor within the camp, but before he can try and root them out, he is persuaded to use his skill in logistics to reinforce the camp's weak spots. Though he gets the job done, Teppei bemoans his inability to contribute further and make a name for himself on the battlefield.
When they go to report back to Gorou, they find that he has gone to the front lines to intercept the Shogun's Army, which is personally being led by Kujou Sara. Though she promises that she has only come for the Traveler, Gorou refuses to give them up. When the Traveler personally appears at the scene, Sara decides to propose a fight of honor â€” a ceremonial contest before battle in which two opposing sides are represented by their finest warriors. Gorou explains that this can give a weaker force a morale boost should their warrior win, though Sara's motivation is to capture the Traveler should they lose; he states that they should not feel like they have to accept, though the Traveler does so anyway. The Traveler's consecutive victories give the Resistance courage, and the two sides engage in direct combat. Though the Shogun's Army begins to get the upper hand, the Resistance's leader,Sangonomiya Kokomiappears with surprise mercenary reinforcements, among which areBeidouandKaedehara Kazuha. With their advantage lost, Sara orders a retreat. Kokomi invites the Traveler toWatatsumi Islandto discuss further plans for the counterattack against the Shogunate.

Grus Nivis ChapterKamisato Ayaka's Quest ChapterQuest TypeStoryGrus Nivis Chapteris theStory Questchapter forKamisato Ayaka.
After leaving theKomore Teahouse, the Traveler is met by Ayaka. Ayaka tells them she was looking through her late mother's belongings when she found a piece of paper mentioning a person named "Tsubaki," who neither she norher brotherhad heard of before. She wishes to meet them, along with bringing a gift per custom. Normally she ask her brother to come, but due to the circumstances, asks the Traveler to come in his place, which they accept.
Ayaka stops by Ogura Textiles & Kimonos, hoping to give Tsubaki a kimono with her own design. The owner,Ogura Mio, is honored by Ayaka's presence. Ayaka shows her the design of the kimono she wishes to have made, but Ogura tells her that due to theSakoku Decree, her business is feeling the pinch from a lack of high-quality silk fromLiyue. However, she states that if they could bring the silk to her, she could start the request. Ayaka also whispers something to Ogura in the process, before telling the Traveler to accompany her toRitouso they could ask theInternational Trade Associationfor silk.
Arriving at Ritou, the pair soon spot a distressedKurisuwho explains to the two that when the association heard that silk was in high demand, they were hoping to sell it to make a profit. However, the silk was stolen by vagrants and Kurisu is hesitant to ask theKanjou Commissionfor help, knowing they would just mock him. Ayaka offers to help instead, much to Kurisu's surprise.
Heading to the scene of the crime, the four spot footprints and follow them. At the end, they find the ronin with the stolen goods. The ronin mock Kurisu, calling him a "worm" and demands payment to get the silk back. Kurisu is about to accept but Ayaka stops him, reminding him of what she told him earlier. Ayaka then proceeds to make an example out of the thieves, who quickly flee without any of the goods in tow. Grateful for her assistance, he initially tries to give the silk to her free of charge, but she insists on paying. As Kurisu returns to Ritou, Ayaka tells the Traveler that she simply did what any person would have done. She's not concerned that word of how she personally intervened in this case will spread around, as the ronin did not recognize her.
They then return to the city and bring the silk to Ogura, who starts to check on her inventory. While she does so, Ayaka offers to have some new clothes tailored for both the Traveler and Paimon, but the Traveler humbly denies her request. She then asks them about what people in the other nations wear, as she has not gone outside of Inazuma yet. Ogura then informs them that she has everything and suggests they do something while she creates the kimono. Ayaka then tells the Traveler and Paimon that she has reserved spots for them atKiminami Restaurant.
At the restaurant, the owner,Kiminami Anna, greets the trio. As she brings out the food, Ayaka states that she has something to do and heads off. Anna tells the Traveler that while Ayaka is looked upon positively, her social standing caused the children of ordinary families to avoid her out of fear, so she had very few friends to start off with. Seeing that she has made a friend makes her happy, and she tells them to watch over Ayaka.
Just then, an explosion goes off and Paimon hears Ayaka screaming. Ayaka comes in and asks the Traveler to help her cook foreign food for Tsubaki, but she was not proficient enough and caused an accident. The Traveler offers to cook in her stead, and Paimon suggestsMushroom Pizza(as it is both delicious and easily made with locally available ingredients). Ayaka is impressed by the Traveler's culinary skills and hopes to cook just as good as them in the future, while Anna comes in and is surprised with the result. The Traveler offers her the recipe for free, which Anna gratefully accepts.
As they eat, Ayaka asks the Traveler if they spoke with Anna and if she said anything about her. Paimon confirms it, much to Ayaka's sadness as she knows she doesn't have many friends. The Traveler and Paimon cheer her back up. Ayaka then tells them that she believes Tsubaki is a fox envoy, since she doesn't know about them at all. Returning to Ogura's store, they pick up the kimono and the "other" requested object. As they leave, Ayaka gives the Traveler awhite heron hairpieceas a gift to them for their company and assistance. They then begin to look for Tsubaki.
Following the notebook's writing, they find themselves in an area underneathTenshukaku. Exploring the area, they find an inconspicuous wall and open it, finding a box inside. Ayaka opens the box to find yet another notebook and reads it. She learns that her mother and Tsubaki are the same person and that she had plenty of desires, but could not do so due to her responsibilities in both the clan and commission. Ayaka then resolves to live every day without regrets and offers to bring the Traveler and Paimon to the festival.
Arriving atAmakane Island, the trio come in just as the festival is about to close. However, Ayaka's sudden appearance has the merchants deciding to stay open a bit longer to keep her entertained. At the end of the festival, Ayaka and the Traveler draw on a prayer panel - Ayaka wants an Inazuma where everyone lives happily, while the Traveler wants to reunite with theirsibling. On the way back to the Kamisato residence, Ayaka performs a dance for the Traveler, thanking them for spending time with her before they part ways.

Carassius Auratus ChapterYoimiya's Quest ChapterQuest TypeStoryCarassius Auratus Chapteris theStory Questchapter forYoimiya.
Wandering around the beaches ofInazuma City, theTravelerandPaimonrun into three children who are looking for theGreat Mujina Youkai, ayoukaithat plays pranks on people. The two are incredulous such a monster exists and tries to tell them it isn't real, but they refuse to believe them and run off towardsYoimiya.
Further down the shoreline, Yoimiya explains that children should enjoy their childhood and that they shouldn't yet need to learn about the harsher facts of life like theVision Hunt Decree. She then mentions  that she has to check on the fireworks for the incoming show and explains to them that her family is well known throughout Inazuma for their spectacular fireworks.
At the shop, Yoimiya's father,Ryuunosuke, greets the trio. He then goes on about the history of fireworks and the family business, but Yoimiya interrupts him, explaining that ever since a "workplace accident," her father is deaf. Yoimiya has to repeat to her father several times about the materials, and he tells her that they hadn't arrived yet.
Around the corner of her house, a man namedSakujiroucrawls out. Yoimiya tells him that after the fireworks show, she'll find a boat for him to escape Inazuma. She explains that Sakujirou is an old customer that he smuggled himself into Inazuma. Despite being Inazuman by birth, theTenryou Commissionput an arrest warrant out for him. Yoimiya reassures him she'll find a way to keep him safe and Sakujirou returns into the house, while the Traveler accompanies Yoimiya on her errands.
Elsewhere in the outskirts of the city, the trio find a man namedKouichi. She asks on the status on the boat, and he tells her that he was questioned. He explains to the pair that since theSakoku Decree, any seaborne vessel being made regardless of size immediately gets the Tenryou's attention. Yoimiya apologizes for dragging him into her mess, but Kouichi insists that it is a payment for all the fireworks her family supplied him over the years. After a short conversation, Yoimiya tells the Traveler that despite all the work she does, she never minds as she wants to keep her customers happy. They return to the city in the hopes of finding materials for the special orders.
With the extra fireworks on hand, they return to the same spot they met Kouichi to wait for him. Yoimiya asks the Traveler about the outside world and if they are willing to stay in Inazuma. Upon hearing that they are looking for their sibling, she realizes how tough the situation they are in but offers them a place in Inazuma and some fireworks if they do return, as she wishes to leave the Traveler a good impression of the nation before they leave. Just then, Kouichi returns and they head to the boat to check on it.
After the escort preparations are complete, Yoimiya informs Sakujirou of the boat. The stowaway states that he regrets coming to Inazuma, stating that he left to avoid responsibility for arriving back here, but eventually heartache made him come back. Yoimiya then mutters about the Tenryou Commission being overzealous before remembering an old couple whose son works there, believing they would help, despite his reservations. Then remembering all the work she had to do, she leaves behind a note for her father.
Heading toKonda Village, the trio find the Imatani couple to deliver their fireworks, while the Imatanis also ask them to deliver some pickled radish toSatoru. After giving the radish and a short conversation, they return to the couple to talk about Sakujirou.
Saburouthen remembers that Yoimiya is busy and she then inquires about Sakujirou. They tell her that he was a good friend of their sonKeisuke, until one day they had a terrible argument as Sakujirou wanted to explore the outside world, while Keisuke stays in Inazuma. Yoimiya thanks them for their time and they return to her house to inform him of the news.
But as they arrive, Ryuunosuke tells them that the Tenryou had raided the house, looking for Sakujirou inside. Fortunately, he was able to escape, but Yoimiya is aware that he hadn't made up his mind yet and the resulting conflict would be disastrous for him. Learning that Keisuke lead the arrest, and that they left the city.
On the road out, they run into a blockade set by the Tenryou Commission and inquire withYoshitaka. Yoshitaka refuses to let them through, so Yoimiya attacks and drives them away. Heading further inside, they find Keisuke and Sakujirou. Sakujirou has accepted his fate after losing to Keisuke, but Yoimiya intervenes and tries to connect them together. Keisuke is initially hesitant but agrees when Yoimiya challenges him to a duel, in which if she lost, she would allow him to arrest her, but if she won, she would have the two openly talk things out.
During the duel, Yoshitaka returns with backup, but Yoimiya prevails. Keisuke orders Yoshitaka to leave and the two reveal that they had a lot on their minds. Due to this, Keisuke allows Sakujirou to leave Inazuma, but reminds him not to kick the bucket early and he will help him if he ever decides to return. As Sakujirou leaves, Keisuke bemoans that he will get demoted, but nonetheless thanks Yoimiya for seeing through him. He then asks if she could make him the firework he used to set off with Sakujirou, but Yoimiya explains that Sakujirou has the order slip. However, seeing that Sakujirou had to leave without the completed firework, she gives that to Keisuke so he can set it off instead.
Yoimiya then takes the Traveler to the top of the cliff onAmakane Islandwhere they witness the show. Sakujirou also catches the show from his boat and on recognizing his firework bursting in the sky, realizes that it was Keisuke that lit it and weeps at the sight. After the show concludes, Yoimiya hands the Traveler a slip for the golden firework as it was her creation for them. She hopes that the show will continue to grow in their hearts as they travel around Teyvat.
InInazuma City, Yoimiya and her fatherNaganohara Ryuunosukeare talking about a trip, which both the Traveler and Paimon overhear as they come down the street. Yoimiya is worried about her parents and asks him to help run the store and take care of her mother while she's gone. As they walk out, the Traveler andPaimonpass by and wave at them. Yoimiya is delighted to see them again, since it's been a while since she last saw them. She tells them that she wants to explore the lands outside Inazuma, as many foreigners have been coming in and many natives going out now that the Sakoku Decree was abolished.
Yoimiya explains that she intends to go on a trip as she wants to watchTeyvat's greatest meteor shower, though she has no idea where it would occur. She hopes that the shower would give her enough inspiration to create a new firework. The Traveler offers to bring her to Sumeru as the first stop, as theRtawahistcould help her locate the meteor shower. Yoimiya is initially worried that she would be using up their time, but Paimon reassures her that it's only right as she helped them many times and they're more than happy to help her. She accepts the offer and they head toRitouto catch a boat there.
During the ride toPort Ormos, the Traveler talks about their travels in Sumeru to Yoimiya, and before anyone knew it, they had arrived at Sumeru. Yoimiya is immediately captivated by the new sights and wonders if the Akademiya is in the port. The Traveler and Paimon tell her that the Akademiya is inSumeru City. Yoimiya initially wants to go there as she still doesn't want to take up their time, but the Traveler insists otherwise and they walk around the port. They stop byAcara Craftsand meetFayezselling someAranaracarvings. Yoimiya is captivated by the carvings and decides to buy them, even easily recalling how the Aranara speak to humans from the brief description of them during the trip. Afterwards, they head to the city, which impresses her even more, though she is worried about going into the Akademiya without proper clothing and decides to let them handle the inquiry for her.
Entering the Akademiya, Paimon realizes they're not sure of whom to ask for help since they only know two from Rtawahist: former Rtawahist sageAzarwas exiled toAvidya Forest, andLaylahas enough trouble handling her schoolwork as it is. She does not want to talk toAlhaithamfor a recommendation either, so the two decide to simply ask around untilNahidasurprises them. Nahida explains that she was going to meet with some researchers, but when she saw them looking around, she decided to follow them. Learning of the situation, Nahida informs them that no one has any precise idea when a meteor shower would occur, nor can they be predicted (though not for a lack of trying) as they are completely random. However, she then comes up with the idea to "lie" by creating the meteor shower in a dream with the assistance of the Aranara, giving them anEmberglow Leafto use when the time was right. She advises them to get the story straight first or Yoimiya would see through it.
Leaving the Akademiya, the Traveler and Paimon review their plan and agree to go with it. Returning to Treasures Street, they find Yoimiya with a young wheelchair-bound girl namedAvin. Yoimiya gives her one of the Aranara carvings before she leaves, just as the Traveler and Paimon walk up. She tells them that she had gotten lost and thus asked Avin for help. Looking at Avin, she deduced that she was down and had guilt due to being incapacitated in a wheelchair and having a sense of yearning. After talking about her, she then asks about the meteor shower and is surprised to learn that it would occur in Sumeru, but would only respond to peoples' dreams.
Needing a new change of scenery, the group heads toDevantaka Mountain. Climbing theRuin Golem, Yoimiya asks about theirsiblingand how they're doing. Regardless, she tells them that she believes that they would come to an understanding once their journey concluded, as they were siblings after all. Once they reach the top of the golem, the Traveler and Paimon remind her about the meteor shower. Yoimiya admits that she wanted to explore for her own reasons at first, but when people began giving her their wishes for the meteor shower, felt that she needed to find one for their sake. However, they need to make the device to spot the shower, causing Paimon to worry as Yoimiya decided to go toAhangarabout it, though the two accept that they may need to roll with some unexpected punches to maintain the lie.
Returning to Sumeru City, they ask Ahangar about the devices. He is initially skeptical about the legends, but agrees to help nonetheless and creates three lenses. However, he expresses dissatisfaction with their quality and tells them about a legendary ore,Urstone, that is revered by blacksmiths, which he hopes to use one day as it indicates the pinnacle of their craft. Yoimiya is eager to find the material, though accepts that they may need to use other substitutes if necessary. Before they could leave,Faridof theCorps of Thirtyand a woman stop to and ask about Avin. The woman isNiousha, Avin's mother. Avin had not returned home after meeting Yoimiya and she explains that after being ill, she became depressed as she wanted to explore the outside world. The group agrees to help and split their search for her.
Asking some of the locals around the city, they find Avin sprawled on the ground outside the city. She complains about not having her wheelchair, so the Traveler looks for it, finding it with somehilichurls. After killing them, they bring the wheelchair back. Avin explains that before she became ill, she enjoyed running and ran with an Aranara friend. But ever since she was bound to her wheelchair, her memories began to fade and she did not want to become an adult having forgotten everything. Yoimiya promises to help her, though this means that she would have to see the Aranara for herself, something which the Traveler had told her was a myth.
Using the Emberglow Leaf, they call an Aranara namedArapurvato the scene, which surprises Avin. Arapurva is surprised by the new Nara and admits that if they had not trusted the Traveler, it would have not answered the call. Yoimiya apologizes for the sudden intrusion but explains about Avin's past to it. Arapurva sympathizes with the situation and deduces that Yoimiya had not "grown up" yet. It explains that Nara grow up and forget a lot of things, but Yoimiya is able to connect with them, stating that her heart is pure and fierce like the sun, and thus deems her trustworthy and can bring them to Avin's friend,Arashani. Arapurva tells them that Arashani is inMawtiyima Forestbut advises that Avin should prepare herself before taking them there.
When they arrive, Paimon asks Arapurva what it meant by "prepared", who tells her that memories and dreams are necessary along with her heart before suddenly leaving. As Avin remarks about her heart, she begins to stand up and is delighted by the fact that she could run again. The Traveler and Paimon realize they're in a dream and they follow them.
Catching up to Yoimiya and Avin, they soon spot a flying object emerge from below them and follow it. When they reach the end, they find a massive blue stone that Avin touches and disappears into. The others follow suit, where Avin reunites with her Aranara friend, Arashani. Once the dream supposedly ends, Avin expresses a desire to help Yoimiya and pulls out a len from her chest. Yoimiya wears it and finds the perfect spot for the meteor shower. When they arrive, many stars emerge from the ground and they enjoy the dream and return to the real world. Yoimiya already knew it had been a dream, but is grateful for the effort they put into it. Returning to the city again, Avin is eager to get back on track and the Traveler spends a few days with Yoimiya in Sumeru before returning to Port Ormos. Niousha having brought Avin with her to see her off, she thanks Yoimiya for her help and expresses an intent to head to Inazuma alone to watch her firework show, which pleases her. Before she departs on the ship, Yoimiya gives the Traveler another Aranara carving that they'd once remarked reminded them of her, wanting them to know that regardless of where they were, she would be there supporting them.

He then goes on about the history of fireworks and the family business, but Yoimiya interrupts him, explaining that ever since a "workplace accident," her father is deaf. Yoimiya has to repeat to her father several times about the materials, and he tells her that they hadn't arrived yet.
Around the corner of her house, a man namedSakujiroucrawls out. Yoimiya tells him that after the fireworks show, she'll find a boat for him to escape Inazuma. She explains that Sakujirou is an old customer that he smuggled himself into Inazuma. Despite being Inazuman by birth, theTenryou Commissionput an arrest warrant out for him. Yoimiya reassures him she'll find a way to keep him safe and Sakujirou returns into the house, while the Traveler accompanies Yoimiya on her errands.
Elsewhere in the outskirts of the city, the trio find a man namedKouichi. She asks on the status on the boat, and he tells her that he was questioned. He explains to the pair that since theSakoku Decree, any seaborne vessel being made regardless of size immediately gets the Tenryou's attention. Yoimiya apologizes for dragging him into her mess, but Kouichi insists that it is a payment for all the fireworks her family supplied him over the years. After a short conversation, Yoimiya tells the Traveler that despite all the work she does, she never minds as she wants to keep her customers happy. They return to the city in the hopes of finding materials for the special orders.
With the extra fireworks on hand, they return to the same spot they met Kouichi to wait for him. Yoimiya asks the Traveler about the outside world and if they are willing to stay in Inazuma. Upon hearing that they are looking for their sibling, she realizes how tough the situation they are in but offers them a place in Inazuma and some fireworks if they do return, as she wishes to leave the Traveler a good impression of the nation before they leave. Just then, Kouichi returns and they head to the boat to check on it.
After the escort preparations are complete, Yoimiya informs Sakujirou of the boat. The stowaway states that he regrets coming to Inazuma, stating that he left to avoid responsibility for arriving back here, but eventually heartache made him come back. Yoimiya then mutters about the Tenryou Commission being overzealous before remembering an old couple whose son works there, believing they would help, despite his reservations. Then remembering all the work she had to do, she leaves behind a note for her father.
Heading toKonda Village, the trio find the Imatani couple to deliver their fireworks, while the Imatanis also ask them to deliver some pickled radish toSatoru. After giving the radish and a short conversation, they return to the couple to talk about Sakujirou.
Saburouthen remembers that Yoimiya is busy and she then inquires about Sakujirou. They tell her that he was a good friend of their sonKeisuke, until one day they had a terrible argument as Sakujirou wanted to explore the outside world, while Keisuke stays in Inazuma. Yoimiya thanks them for their time and they return to her house to inform him of the news.
But as they arrive, Ryuunosuke tells them that the Tenryou had raided the house, looking for Sakujirou inside. Fortunately, he was able to escape, but Yoimiya is aware that he hadn't made up his mind yet and the resulting conflict would be disastrous for him. Learning that Keisuke lead the arrest, and that they left the city.
On the road out, they run into a blockade set by the Tenryou Commission and inquire withYoshitaka. Yoshitaka refuses to let them through, so Yoimiya attacks and drives them away. Heading further inside, they find Keisuke and Sakujirou. Sakujirou has accepted his fate after losing to Keisuke, but Yoimiya intervenes and tries to connect them together. Keisuke is initially hesitant but agrees when Yoimiya challenges him to a duel, in which if she lost, she would allow him to arrest her, but if she won, she would have the two openly talk things out.
During the duel, Yoshitaka returns with backup, but Yoimiya prevails. Keisuke orders Yoshitaka to leave and the two reveal that they had a lot on their minds. Due to this, Keisuke allows Sakujirou to leave Inazuma, but reminds him not to kick the bucket early and he will help him if he ever decides to return. As Sakujirou leaves, Keisuke bemoans that he will get demoted, but nonetheless thanks Yoimiya for seeing through him. He then asks if she could make him the firework he used to set off with Sakujirou, but Yoimiya explains that Sakujirou has the order slip. However, seeing that Sakujirou had to leave without the completed firework, she gives that to Keisuke so he can set it off instead.
Yoimiya then takes the Traveler to the top of the cliff onAmakane Islandwhere they witness the show. Sakujirou also catches the show from his boat and on recognizing his firework bursting in the sky, realizes that it was Keisuke that lit it and weeps at the sight. After the show concludes, Yoimiya hands the Traveler a slip for the golden firework as it was her creation for them. She hopes that the show will continue to grow in their hearts as they travel around Teyvat.

Teppeitakes theTravelertoWatatsumi Islandfor their meeting withSangonomiya Kokomi. She tells them how she recently accepted an anonymous letter's offer to providethe Resistancewith material so long as they continue to fight theInazuma Shogunate. Despite her doubts about the sender's motives, Watatsumi Island's lack of resources left her with little alternative. As the conversation turns to theVision Hunt Decree, Kokomi voices her opinion that theTenryou Commission's and theRaiden Shogun's attitudes towards it "don't add up." After affirming the Traveler's resolve to aid the Resistance despite its precarious situation, Kokomi immediately makes them captain of Swordfish II, a special operations unit. Teppei, eager to step into the battlefield himself, asks for a combat role and is promised one.
After completing their first task with the members of Swordfish II, the unit is assigned to investigate the mysterious disappearance of supplies aroundFort Mumei. They stay inBourou Villageto train for a few days and chat with Teppei, who has since become the captain of a newly formed special operations unit himself. He gives a glowing review of their new sponsor's supplies and departs for his next mission in high spirits, leaving Paimon awed by Teppei's unexpected improvement.
While the investigation at Fort Mumei fails to reveal any leads, they notice some oddities in the area. Teppei arrives to provide assistance â€” with graying hair and a persistent cough. He dismisses his condition to a cold he got at sea, and explains that the strange atmosphere they are feeling is caused by theTatarigami, a phenomenon which emerged after the death ofOrobashi, thegodof Watatsumi Island slain by theEiduring theArchon War. Since then,Narukami Islandand Watatsumi Island have had poor relations. Teppei parts ways with them, warning them that Tatarigami can have ill effects on one's health.
Upon returning to Watatsumi Island, the Traveler finds Kokomi and GeneralGoroudiscussing one of the secret weapons that an officer surrendered to Gorou and their effects on members of the Resistance that have held onto them. The Traveler is horrified to identify the weapon as a vitality-absorbingDelusion, revealing the Resistance's mysterious 'sponsor' is none other than theFatui. Kokomi orders that the Resistance be informed to stop using Delusions immediately, and the users be recalled for medical treatment. Realizing that Teppei's condition and sudden burst in combat prowess is likely the result of using one, the Traveler rushes off to find him â€” and find themselves too late. Teppei, now with the physical appearance of an old man, is distraught that the new power he thought he finally obtained has instead led him to his demise. As Teppei's life fades away, the Traveler is overcome by fury and swears revenge on the Fatui.
To salvage the situation that the Fatui have landed them in, the Traveler decides to dismantle their Delusion manufacturing scheme on their own. Although Kokomi realizes that the Fatui must have had "local support," she is unable to calm the Traveler down and hesitantly gives them the Delusion factory's suspected location. Inside, the Traveler and Paimon realize that the Delusions are being produced with theCrystal Marrowcollected by theKanjou Commission, and they can find a notice revealing that supposed Resistance memberNathanis actually a Fatui mole sent to sabotage them.
The two cut their way through the facility before finding themselves face-to-face withThe Balladeer, one of theEleven Fatui Harbingers. He takes glee in mocking the "weak" and reveals how all of Inazuma has fallen for the Fatui's schemes, goading the Traveler into falling for his trap. As the Traveler succumbs to the Tatarigami and falls unconscious,Yae Mikoarrives at the scene.
The Traveler reawakens at theGrand Narukami Shrine, having been rescued by Yae Miko. After reassuring them that Kokomi has resolved the situation at the Delusion factory, Miko explains that she has taken an interest in them given that they metEiâ€” the true Raiden Shogun who dwells within her inner world known as thePlane of Euthymia.The Shogunwho manages Inazuma's affairs is a puppet made in her likeness, designed with the singular pursuit of eternity. The Traveler intrigued Ei enough to become the first person to meet her since she entered the Plane of Euthymia, which Miko believes will be the key to saving both Inazuma and Ei from a disastrous future.
Miko puts the Traveler through grueling training so they can survive the Electro Archon's attacks, let alone defeat her. Even though neither the Traveler nor the Resistance are any match for Ei in direct combat, Miko is convinced that both will be able to play their parts when the time comes. To weaken the Tenryou Commission, which is spearheading the war, Yae Miko plans to turnKujou Saraagainst them by proving thatKujou Takayuki, Sara's adoptive father and head of theKujou Clan, has betrayed the Shogunate. Having invited Sara to the shrine, Yae promises the general that they will provide the evidence if Sara agrees to secretly return alone in three days to hear them out further.
To find the evidence they need, the Traveler returns toKomore Teahouseto meet withKamisato AyakaandThoma. With the help ofYoimiyasupplying the Traveler with a distraction so that theShuumatsubanninjaSayucan easier infiltrate the Tenryou Commission, they successfully obtain Takayuki's falsified, optimistic report of the Shogunate's war efforts and a correspondence with the Fatui.
Upon reading the documents, Kujou Sara is infuriated by what she sees and storms off to confront her adoptive father. Before the Traveler and Paimon can chase after her, Miko advises them that the only way to meet Ei will be to recreate the scenario as with their first encounter. She also gives them anomamorias a farewell gift, imparting them with vague promises about what it can do for them.
The two join up with Sara and fight their way through the Tenryou guards until they reach Takayuki. In the ensuing confrontation, he confirms all that they have read, revealing his selfish reasons for accepting the Fatui's proposals. After learning that the Fatui HarbingerSignorais meeting with the Shogun atTenshukaku, Sara runs off to confront her, with the Traveler and Paimon following shortly after.
By the time the Traveler reaches Tenshukaku, they find that Signora has defeated Sara. While Sara's Inazuman heritage spares her from further harm, Signora reminds the Traveler in their ensuing confrontation that they have no such provision as Inazuma's most wanted criminal. Remembering that the victor of a duel before the throne is given a second chance, the Traveler challenges Signora to a duel and the Shogun approves it. Despite the odds, Signora is defeated and is executed by the Shogun'sMusou no Hitotachi, her most powerful technique. The Traveler and Paimon, shaken by the display of the Shogun's strength, are given permission to leave Tenshukaku alive.
Outside Tenshukaku, the Traveler and Paimon run into the Resistance forces led by Gorou. Just then, the Shogun cuts through the space behind the Traveler, intending to execute them.Kaedehara Kazuhamiraculously resonates with hislate friend's MasterlessVision, using its Electro power combined with his Anemo Vision to block the Musou no Hitotachi and knock the Shogun back. Although she quickly recovers, witnessing the incredible feat invigorates the Resistance members and they charge at her. To prevent them from being slaughtered, the Traveler attacks the Shogun and is brought into the Plane of Euthymia.
Ei turns out to have been aware of the Fatui's involvement all along, having deemed Visions â€” specifically, the pursuit of one's aspirations â€” to be a greater threat to eternity than a temporary war, her own inaction having been tacit approval. Their clash of wills turns into a duel once again. In the middle of their battle, Miko uses the omamori to enter the Plane of Euthymia, reminding the Traveler that they are fighting on behalf of those who wish for the Vision Hunt Decree's abolition. The light of human ambition from the confiscated Visions outside illuminates the dark and gloomy Plane of Euthymia, and the Traveler defeats Ei with their newfound strength.
After Ei recounts her motivations for pursuing eternity â€” experiencing the deaths of her close companions and her sisterMakoto, and witnessing theHeavenly Principles' destruction ofKhaenri'ahâ€” Miko eventually persuades her that her idea of eternity is bringing too much suffering and loneliness to even herself, pointing out that even the sky of the Plane had lit up with a predawn light as Ei had emotionally 'lit up' with meeting her friend after so long. Conceding to Miko's point, Ei agrees to abolish the Vision Hunt Decree, but tells them that she will need time to reconsider her approach towards ruling Inazuma.
After the dust has settled, the Traveler and Paimon meet with Yae Miko. Their delight over stopping the Fatui's plans is dampened when Miko reveals that she rescued them from The Balladeer by giving him the ElectroGnosis. Having no more use for it, Ei had entrusted it to her before entering the Plane of Euthymia with the knowledge that Miko would 'sell' it, but only for something equally as valuable. As a gesture of thanks for their contributions to Inazuma, Miko offers to answer whatever questions they might have. Her answers give a few important pieces of information: The Balladeer was Ei's prototype puppet who was recruited into the Fatui and augmented until he was strong enough to become the Sixth Harbinger; and that knowledge is managed as a resource inSumeru, the Traveler and Paimon's next stop, although Miko is unsure whether this wasLesser Lord Kusanali's decision or the Sages'. In her parting statement, Miko speculates that the Traveler's lack of a Vision may actually be because they have not yet found an ambition strong enough for them to receive one.

Requiem of the Echoing DepthsTraveler's Quest ActQuest TypeChapterArchonIIActIVPreviousNextOmnipresence Over MortalsThrough Mists of Smoke and Forests DarkRequirementsAdventure RankRequired30
Requiem of the Echoing Depthsis the fourth act inChapter IIof theArchon Quests. It involves theTravelerandDainsleifinThe Chasm.
TheTravelerandPaimonaccept a commission fromYuehui, a miner, regarding strangehilichurlactivity inThe Chasm. Believing theAbyss Orderis involved, the two venture into the depths of theunderground minesand discover anInverted Citywhich reminds them of theDefiled Statue. Just then, Dainsleif appears from a portal behind them, having pursued anAbyss Heraldthrough its portal only to be separated from it. When Dainsleif chased theTraveler's Siblinginto a portal the last time they saw each other, the same thing happened to him then.
This prompts the Traveler to ask about his background, which their sibling alluded to during their last confrontation, as well as the relationship between the two. Dainsleif tells them that "Twilight Sword" was his title as captain ofKhaenri'ah's Royal Guard five hundred years ago; the Sibling, meanwhile, was his traveling companion in their search for their fates, but they "did not make it to the journey's end together." He quickly changes the subject back to the Abyss Order, which he suspects has plans for the area, and the trio move further in to investigate.
The investigation leads Dainsleif to suspect that the hilichurls have come to The Chasm to live out the end of their lives, sensing that this area mitigates the curse of immortality placed on Khaenri'ahns during thecataclysm, although he is unsure of the principles at work. They are interrupted by two attackingBlack Serpent Knights, who were Dainsleif's subordinates before they succumbed to the curse and lost their minds. However, one Knight does not attack them, instead staring at Dainsleif before retreating. The group ponders whether it recognized Dainsleif, a feat he believed was impossible without "it."
After reaching the Inverted City, Dainsleif believes that the city likely belonged to a civilization older than Khaenri'ah. They defeat some Black Serpent Knights and discover they were protecting a group of hilichurls at the end of their lives, confirming Dainsleif's earlier suspicions. Before the Black Serpent Knight reinforcements can attack, the Knight from earlier stops them and silently orders them to retreat. Dainsleif believes the Knight must beHalfdan, a Royal Guard elite during the cataclysm whom he ordered to "inform all Black Serpent Knights to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs." Ever since then, despite the curse eroding their minds, these knights have been trying to fulfill their last orders.
No longer impeded by the Black Serpent Knights, the group climbs to the summit and find a water pool, a relic of the ancient civilization and the source of the area's ability to weaken the curse. Before they can investigate the strange devices located around it, Halfdan then arrives and urges them to follow him.
The three end up in a hilichurl camp, where the Traveler finds anInteyvat, the Khaenri'ah national flower. Upon touching it, they have a vision of their Sibling and an Abyss Herald discussing their plan to amplify the water pool's special properties, remove the curse from the gathered hilichurls, and restore "the homeland." Due to the reality-changing nature of the curse, Dainsleif deems this a futile effort and tells the Traveler that it will only bring the hilichurls even more suffering. The Traveler decides to help him stop their Sibling's plan, believing that their Sibling has no right to subject others to near-guaranteed suffering for an infinitesimally small chance of redemption.
As they leave the settlement, the Abyss Order puts their plan into motion. After vanquishing the Abyss Herald attempting to delay them, the group rushes back to destroy the device.
Just as they enter the chamber, anAbyss Lectoractivates the amplification device, causing all those affected by the curse to experience agonizing pain. Halfdan sacrifices himself to temporarily stop the device, buying the Traveler enough time to defeat the Lector and destroy the mechanisms powering the device. In the wake of Halfdan's death, the distraught party turns to leave when Halfdan's soul appears before them, briefly conversing with Dainsleif before passing on. Dainsleif leaves to recuperate from the device's effects and to investigate the Abyss Order'sLoom of Fateproject, while the Traveler and Paimon report back to Yuehui.

TheTravelerandPaimoncontinue their search for answers inSumeruby seeking an audience with theDendro Archon. After passing through the tunnel fromCinnabar CliffinThe Chasmand emerging into the lush rainforest of Sumeru, they ask passing scholarHaypasiafor directions, only to find themselves completely ignored. Reasoning she would likely lead them to a human settlement, they decide to follow her. However, she instead enters a cave and lights some incense, the scent of which causes the Traveler to faint. They have a vision of a massive, glowing, white tree under a red sky; upon approaching it, they hear a feminine voice say, "...World... Forget me..." The vision ends as the Traveler awakens inGandharva Ville, where they were taken by Forest RangersTighnariandColleito receive treatment. After hearing Tighnari's explanation about their "hallucination," the Traveler suspects that he was not being truthful and decides to ask Collei for information.
The next day, Tighnari allows the Traveler and Paimon to accompany Collei on her patrol route while he and the other Forest Rangers handle a longer, more dangerous one. The two learn that there have been two Dendro Archons:Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, who died during thecataclysm, andLesser Lord Kusanali, the current Archon. Lesser Lord Kusanali was discovered after Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death and brought back toSumeru City, where she now lives in theSanctuary of Surasthana. Collei knows nothing else, attributing her lack of knowledge of the Archon to the amount of time she spent away from Sumeru â€” a story which is detailed in theManga. She reveals that she knew who they were the moment she saw them, as she is dear friends withAmberand lived inMondstadtfor a time. They regularly write to each other, and Amber related how the Traveler and Paimon got involved with theStormterrorincident.
While treating the two to some food and drinks, Collei defends Tighnari's character after Paimon criticizes the way he speaks to her. In a moment of silliness, Paimon touches Collei, causing the girl to panic. She attempts to downplay her outburst, but immediately flees back to Gandharva Ville and retires to bed, leaving the other two baffled.
The next morning, the two find Collei bedridden; she was born withEleazar, a disease endemic to Sumeru which consigns the afflicted to a slow and agonizing death. Her symptoms were once successfully suppressed byThe Doctor, one of theEleven Fatui Harbingers, but the agonizing experiments she was subjected to traumatized her and made her touch-averse. They volunteer to gather ingredients for Collei's medication with Tighnari, but take a detour after learning that aWithering Zonehas formed in a Forest Ranger patrol route; only those with elemental abilities can withstand a Withering Zone's effects, leaving Tighnari and the Traveler as the only ones capable of immediately handling it.
Once the area returns to normal, Tighnari voices concern over the rapidity of Withering Zone appearances; not only do they damage the ecosystem, but they also cause Eleazar symptoms to worsen. The Withering, he explains, stems from a disease affectingIrminsul, a giant tree in the depths of the world which hasLey Linesfor roots. Irminsul absorbs the memories accumulated within the Ley Lines, and the Dendro Archon is known as the God of Wisdom due to her consciousness' direct connection to Irminsul. However, not even theAranara, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's familiars who informed Tighnari's ancestors of all of this, know how to cure Irminsul; and thus The Withering has continued to affect Sumeru for thousands of years.
After returning to the village, aDusk Birdfrom Haypasia delivers a desperate plea for food and water. Now convinced that the Traveler can be entrusted with Sumeru's fate, Tighnari reveals the truth behind their vision: The incense caused the Traveler's consciousness to connect to Irminsul, and what they witnessed was a real memory contained within it. Given that connecting to Irminsul is the purpose of Haypasia's training, Tighnari believes she may have more insight into the vision and sends them to deliver her emergency rations.
Upon entering Haypasia's cave, the Traveler unwittingly stumbles on anAranara, which induces a dream on them as a distraction. The dream highlights their doubts about their journey's purpose and their relationship withtheir sibling, voiced through an undefeatableAbyss Herald. After the Traveler awakens from the dream, they and Paimon discover that the Aranara was taking care of Haypasia while she was unconscious. The Traveler also finds that they'd dropped the boxed lunch in their dream-induced state, so they use the fruit the Aranara had left behind to raise Haypasia's blood sugar before cookingRadish Veggie SoupandSweet Madamefor the three of them.
Haypasia explains how difficult it normally is to connect one's consciousness to Irminsul, and how manySumeru Akademiyaresearchers have lost their minds after touching divine knowledge in Irminsul. It took her three years to connect to Irminsul and was lauded as a genius, and it was also the day she was able to see the Aranara, such as the 'neighbor' who helped her. However, she has no answers regarding the vision, believing she may understand more once she reaches the next step of her training. While discussing the Aranara, she observes a contradiction between their power over dreams compared to Sumeru people's inability to dream as adults â€” which the Sages claim is Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's way of protecting her people from the irrationality and disorderliness of dreams.
The Traveler and Paimon return to Gandharva Ville and find SageKhajehand his subordinates personally trying to recruit Tighnari into a top-secret Akademiya project. However, even the threat of disappointing his teacher, SageNaphis, fails to sway Tighnari and the Akademiya's emissaries leave empty-handed. To aid the Traveler's search for a way to meet Lesser Lord Kusanali, Tighnari tells them to meetRohawi, an acquaintance of his in Sumeru City.
At the entrance to Sumeru City, a new policy grants the Traveler and Paimon each an Akasha Terminal, a device used to access Sumeru's knowledge-grantingAkasha System. However, asking the Akasha directly or indirectly doesn't really work, nor Rohawi,Katheryne, or theCorps of ThirtyadvisorAsfandare able to tell them how to meet with the Archon. The Akademiya holds Lesser Lord Kusanali in less esteem compared to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, so the new Archon's lack of presence has gone unquestioned by the people of Sumeru.
The two are approached by a follower of Lesser Lord Kusanali's namedDunyarzad. AlthoughDehya, Dunyarzad's bodyguard, interrupts them to bring the runaway Dunyarzad back home, she changes her mind after seeing Dunyarzad's resolve to do something meaningful for her Archon. To repay the Archon for supporting her during a childhood bout of illness, Dunyarzad hopes to revive theSabzeruz Festival, an obscure celebration of Lesser Lord Kusanali's birthday. She takes the group to meetNilou, another follower of Lesser Lord Kusanali's who will perform the Dance of Sabzeruz, the centerpiece of the event. After telling the group about its history as a dance performed by theGoddess of Flowers, Nilou expresses her wish for realPadisarahs, a vibrant purple flower which went extinct after the Goddess of Flowers died thousands of years ago. Greater Lord Rukkhadevata caused her own version of Padisarahs to grow in the goddess's memory but was unable to get the same shade of purple.
While looking around the Bazaar, the Traveler and Paimon briefly converse with Katheryne, who is taking a break from herAdventurers' Guildpost. The two have little time to discuss her unusually informal speech before Dehya approaches them with a possible lead on meeting Lesser Lord Kusanali. They learn from Asfand that an Akademiya convoy atAaru Villagewas robbed, much to Grand SageAzar's alarm. While most information on the missing inventory is classified, the item has to do with "the Akasha, knowledge, and even the gods," and is currently somewhere inPort Ormos.
At Port Ormos, the Traveler and Paimon learn that some extremist Eremite groups, including one known asAyn Al-Ahmar, are spreading rumors that the long-deceasedKing Deshretâ€” agodwhom they believe Greater Lord Rukkhadevata betrayed to gain control of Sumeru â€” will soon revive. They witness a dispute between members of Ayn Al-Ahmar and a man from the Akademiya namedAlhaitham, which ends with the two parties agreeing to fight in a few days. Realizing that Alhaitham has details about the Akademiya's missing item, the Traveler convinces him to collaborate with them. He tells them that the missing item is aKnowledge Capsule, used to obtain knowledge beyond the Akasha's limitations, but refuses to give them further information before they complete a task for him: To become customers ofDori, a shrewd merchant who refuses to do business with anyone affiliated with the Akademiya due to the nature of her wares. Given a hefty sum and instructed not to haggle, the two gain her trust and return to Alhaitham.
After reconvening, Alhaitham and the Traveler tell each other why they are investigating the Akademiya's missing item â€” a Divine Knowledge Capsule, which Alhaitham intends on studying to find out what "divine knowledge" entails. With Dori's help, they discover that Ayn Al-Ahmar's leader,Mizri, has obtained it, and plan on forcing the Eremites to give them access to the Capsule during their scheduled fight. While the fight initially goes as planned, Mizri goes berserk after using the Divine Knowledge Capsule and attacks some of his group. Alhaitham ends the fight by severing Mizri's connection to his Akasha Terminal, and theMatratake Mizri into custody. As he is being led away, Mizri mutters "...World ...Forget me..."
As the trio discusses the events that transpired, Alhaitham and the Traveler both withhold information from the other: Alhaitham, that he swiped the Divine Knowledge Capsule from Mizri; the Traveler, that they heard Mizri's words in a vision. Alhaitham compares Mizri's state to that of researchers who have gone insane after connecting to Irminsul, concluding that the Capsule grants neither divine knowledge nor power. After finding that Alhaitham, too, knows nothing about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the two parties go their separate ways, with the Traveler and Paimon returning to Sumeru City for the Sabzeruz Festival. Once they leave, Alhaitham debates whether to "deal with" the Divine Knowledge Capsule, or produce a certain report for the Sages.

After returning to theGrand Bazaar, theTravelerandPaimonrecount their escapades inPort OrmostoDunyarzad, who expresses her wish to join them in the future only to be scolded byDehya. Seeing that Paimon is tired, Dunyarzad provides the traveling pair with accommodations for the night. The next morning, the two meet up with Dunyarzad and begin browsing the event venues as Dunyarzad explains the traditions. After departing fromVihar's venue â€” where the player has to pick a mystery box of Yalda Candy flavors â€” the three run intoEremitemercenaries planning on taking Dunyarzad hostage for ransom. Dehya appears and takes the mercenaries on alone so the three can escape.
Although they successfully get away, Dunyarzad's frail constitution leaves her exhausted. Dehya soon catches up, having driven off the mercenaries but getting wounded in return. It turns out that she was injured because she was still getting acclimated to her new greatsword; she sold her old one to donate towards the Sabzeruz Festival. Dunyarzard's health begins to falter again, so the Traveler agrees to bring her somewhere safe while Dehya patrols the area. As they rest, Dunyarzad undoes the wrappings around her palms and wrists, revealing that she was born withEleazarand that it has progressed to a terminal stage; as such, she is doing everything she can for the Sabzeruz Festival so she will not leave behind any regrets once she passes away. Realizing it is almost time for the Dance of Sabzeruz, the three hurry to the Grand Bazaar.
They arrive to findNiloubeing confronted by Grand SageAzarand his secretary,Setaria. Azar claims that the festival violates several laws and prematurely shuts the festival down, declaring that all public art performances will be banned starting with the nextJnagarbha Dayand departing with some enigmatic words about celebrating "the birth of that god to your heart's content." Although Nilou tries to come up with a way of continuing with the dance anyway, Dunyarzad decides that they should comply with the Grand Sage's orders. The Traveler and Paimon lament that given Dunyarzad's situation, she will have to live out the rest of her life with the regret of being unable to see Nilou's performance.
Elsewhere, a *beep* sound is heard as anunknown voicestates that "The project has entered its most critical phase."
The morning of the Sabzeruz Festival repeats itself, causing the Traveler to feel increasing amounts of dÃ©jÃ  vu. After picking the mystery box at Vihar's stall, the Traveler takes their leave and heads toLambad's Tavern, believing they might shake off the sensation by eating something they'd never tried before and appears to be somewhat unappetizing,Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cake. Much to the Traveler's surprise, not only is it delicious, but the taste is familiar despite the incongruence with their memories, meaning they must have tried doing this before.
As they leave, they find Dunyarzad sitting at the bench, having escaped her pursuers alone. Although the two sense that Dunyarzad is less energetic than usual, she attributes it to her constitution and heads to the Grand Bazaar, where Azar and Setaria once again confront Nilou. Having failed to make any discoveries, the two go to sleep and hear the same beep again. Meanwhile, the project continues, despite seeing a drop in "Jnana Energy" output levels.
As the festival loops again, the Traveler has the flavors for each mystery box memorized, much to Paimon and Vihar's shock. Upon spottinga strange girl, the Traveler chases after her to theBimarstanhospital, where they find a second Dunyarzad sleeping on a bed. The mysterious girl has them use Canned Knowledge containing the memories they have accumulated from countless days' worth of the one-day festival 'samsara', or cycle. The Dunyarzad on the bed is the real one, continuously weakening with each samsara. The girl introduces herself as Nahida and asks them to find a way to break the cycle while she tries to delay Dunyarzad's illness, tasking them with discovering the reason behind the samsara. She has many of the answers they need but cannot tell them directly, as it would be harmful to their mental well-being.
After failing to find any useful information, they decide to enlist Dehya's help. After convincing her that something is amiss, they take her to see the real Dunyarzad. While Dehya is unable to see or hear Dunyarzad or Nahida, she senses Dunyarzad's aura and is convinced that they are telling her the truth. After listening to the Traveler's explanation, Dehya suspects thatSumeru Akademiya's sages are responsible for the samsara and are using theAkashato pull it off. Nahida explains that the Akasha uses the DendroArchon'sGnosisto operate, compile knowledge and grant it to its users. When the Traveler suggests their increasing mental fatigue is related to the Akasha, Dehya correctly deduces that the Akasha is extracting information from their minds to figuratively create a single, massive brain which can compute any information the sages desire.
The three take their terminals off to cut themselves off from the samsara, but hear the beeping sound again from within their heads and fall unconscious. Meanwhile, the mysterious voice (Khajeh's) warns that the project is taking longer than expected, and that there will likely be casualties. Another mysterious voice (Azar's) decides to continue regardless.
The next day begins, confirming that removing their Akasha Terminals is useless, but that the Akasha itself is certainly involved. Nahida refuses to reveal her identity saying it is currently unimportant, but does compare herself as being "the Moon". When they find Dehya again, the two notice that she wasn't injured fighting the kidnappers. She acknowledges that the ease with which she can use her new greatsword is abnormal as that requires building up muscle memory, making the two hopeful that something might have changed due to the removal of their terminals. However, Nahida simply congratulates them on their new information and tells them to wait for the next day, as it's not worth speculating today on what they will learn tomorrow.
After the beep, Azar orders the project to continue, believing that "these sacrifices are trivial" compared to their end goal.
The following day, the Traveler amends their theory that the samsara is not a time loop but simply mass memory erasure of a single day which would cause one to think that the previous day hadn't happened, but are told it is wrong and Nahida suggests they check in with Dehya. Dehya points out that while the Mora people spent during each loop could technically be refunded to them, perishables like food keep being 'reset'. She proves that it isn't possible by showing them a training dummy she's used over several days, stating that the sages would have no way to reproduce her swordsmanship of each strike for each loop. Concluding that they are not in the real world, they realize that they have never tried leaving the city. When they tell Nahida their plan, she reveals that they already tried twice but failed to return throughout the night. Curious as to why they have no relevant memories despite Nahida's prior intervention, they decide to test it out the next day.
In the morning, the Traveler discovers that two days have passed since they started their plan. On the first day, the Traveler left the city alone so Paimon could witness what happened, but immediately disappeared after leaving the city limits and failed to return, while the Traveler's own memories of it were erased. On the second day, Nahida modified an Akasha Terminal so the Traveler could record messages about what they saw in the outside world.
In the present, the recorded messages lead to the revelation that the Akasha compiles wisdom by stealing the people of Sumeru's dreams, which occur during a stage of sleep when brain activity is high, and the sages' rhetoric about dreams being detrimental to people is a lie used to cover up this fact. The samsara is putting the consciousnesses of the people of Sumeru into a collective dream of the Sabzeruz Festival, which makes them repeatedly "wake up" to a new day while the Akasha mass harvests their now-vacant dreams. On Nahida's invitation to guess her identity, they also deduce that she is actuallyLesser Lord Kusanali, the Dendro Archon they have been looking for. As they contemplate why the sages' end goal, the beep rings and they await the next day.
The next day, Nahida sadly informs them that Dunyarzad's consciousness has disappeared, as it could no longer handle the Akasha harvesting. She confirms that she was the voice that inspired Dunyarzad as a child, and is upset that as "not a real archon", she wasn't able to save her most faithful follower, but they comfort her saying that archons are still allowed to be sad. The Traveler and Paimon are also saddened by her apparent demise, but Nahida tells them how to break the samsara; by making the host of the samsara realize they're dreaming. Only humans can create dreams, and the samsara was created from the dream of an unaware host. Once the host becomes aware of the dream (lucid dreaming) they can then take full control of it. In the meantime, Nahida plans to leave the city to travel the stolen dreams for a last-ditch effort that she doesn't specify.
They first decide to go toViharbut discover that other than him having a crush on Dunyarzad, he isn't the host. After hearing Dehya yelling in the distance, the Traveler goes to her to help against the Eremites, even though Dehya handled them herself in the previous cycles.
Ordering Dehya to leave, the Traveler takes their anger over Dunyarzad's fate on the Eremites before deciding to investigate what Dunyarzad had forgotten. However, feeling it would be rude to enter her rented room without permission, Paimon notices an open window and flies inside. She discovers a diary of compiled research on Lesser Lord Kusanali based on interviews Dunyarzad conducted with people, with the goal of gifting it to the Traveler and Paimon. Running off to the puppet Dunyarzad, they thank it before sitting down on the nearby bench. They then decide to watch the Dance of Sabzeruz and find Azar and Setaria scolding Nilou. However, the Traveler steps in, causing them to freeze; this confirms their suspicions that they were actually puppets, as the sages would not subject themselves to dream harvesting.
Nilou is surprised by the Traveler's intervention before they notice that the flowers at the back of the stage are originalPadisarahs, causing them to realize that Nilou is the host of the dream sinceNabu Malikata's Padisarahs have been long extinct. The Traveler instructs Nilou to close her eyes and imagine Azar and Setaria vanishing, which removes the puppets from the dream. As Paimon wonders how to break her out of the dream, Nilou realizes that she's dreaming and explains about the tale of the First Sage. Now aware she is lucid dreaming, Nilou performs the dance as the dreamscape dissolves, during which the two also see Dunyarzad's spirit in the crowd, watching Nilou dance. Waking up, they run back to Bimarstan, finding Dunyarzad with her mind fully intact if nursing a headache, and Katheryne next to her.
Talking to "Katheryne", they realize by her voice that it is just Nahida possessing her. She suggests speaking elsewhere and they stop by the same bench, where Nahida reveals that after leaving the city in the last cycle, she successfully found a fragment of Dunyarzhad's dying consciousness. It was too weak for the Akasha to harvest, but as Nahida had suspected, also now outside its control. She then used all of her power to sustain Dunyarzhad's dream until the samsara broke, which the Traveler and Paimon had accomplished just in time. After answering their questions, she tells them she is significantly tired from keeping Dunyarzhad alive, but tells the two that the Akasha would be unable to host an event of such size for some time. She plans to investigate what caused the sages to step out of line before disconnecting from Katheryne to rest. As she leaves, Katheryne comes back to her own senses and asks the two what happened.

Dreams, Emptiness, Deceptionis the third act inChapter IIIof theArchon Quests.
As they've not heard back fromNahidafor some time,Paimonsuggests checking in withKatherynefor any commissions to keep themselves busy. When they arrive, she offers strange commissions, causing them to realize that they're actually talking to the archon instead. Nahida has a plan to try to figure out what the sages are learning but suggests speaking elsewhere. Paimon asks aboutDunyarzad's health, to which Nahida states that she's recovering, but to fully removeEleazar, they need to fixIrminsul's withering.
At the arranged spot, Nahida asks theTravelerfor their suggestions, all of which she declines due to the immense risks or not being possible to enact. She instead reveals that they should find someone who has ties with them but hasn't fully dedicated their cause. The Traveler suggestsAlhaitham, but Nahida had already decided onSetaria,Azar's subordinate. Setaria actually hails from the desert and was proclaimed as the greatest genius amongst the desert-dwellers, like the brightest star in the night sky, but is plagued by her guilt over the sages' questionable work and inability to use her studies to help the desert people. As such, she believes that if they can make Setaria confront her guilt, they'll have a mole on the inside.
Nahida takes them to the marketplace where she talks withNabiya,AkimandQishanas Katheryne, while the Traveler learns how they speak and act. The following day, as Setaria prepares to shop on her regular day off, Nahida tells the Traveler that because she still has trouble with human behavior, they'll be the ones to do the job. She uses her powers to act as a bridge, allowing the Traveler to remotely possesses them through theirAkasha Terminaland passes off the impression that they're believers ofKing Deshret. During her conversation with Nabiya, they learn that King Deshret's resurrection is actually a misinformation campaign by the Akademiya. After talking to the three, Setaria panics and flags downRimato warn the matra of the heretics, but Rima is quickly possessed by Nahida/the Traveler and forces Setaria to admit her guilt and promise to help. Setaria also reveals that anexpelled outcastreturned to the city, causing the sages to be wary.
Worried that the Akademiya might be keeping tabs on her, Setaria advises to have what documents she has access to picked up by someone at the entrance the following night. When the time comes, the Traveler and Nahida note that there's far fewer people out on the streets, causing them some worry. Nonetheless, they head to the Akademiya entrance, where they find many people in a trance. Suddenly, a man appears and introduces himself as Il Dottore, the second of theEleven Fatui Harbingers. Dottore reveals that had Setaria been more careful, she would have found the listening device that had been planted on her and has been put in confinement. He manipulated the peoples' Akasha Terminals to believe that the Traveler is a hero that had just saved the world, causing them to approach them. However, Nahida uses her powers to put them all to sleep and urges them to run, but at the cost of exposing her presence within Katheryne.
After gaining enough distance, Paimon is shocked to discover a high-ranking Harbinger in Sumeru and that the Fatui were also involved in the sages' plot. With no other leads to go on, the Traveler decides to visitTighnari, as he might know more about the project he'd turned down participating in.
Making their way toGandharva Ville, the Traveler and Paimon are ambushed by an Eremite group led byTashfin, although they manage to repel the mercenaries. Arriving in the village, they findCollei, who's glad to see them. She remarks that her Eleazar condition has gotten worse recently and as such, Tighnari ordered her to stay in town. She also reveals that he suddenly left, which was unusual in itself, forPardis Dhyaifor reasons unknown.
Arriving at Pardis Dhyai, the pair run into Nahida, who had escaped Dottore's grasp by mind-jumping at the last second. However, she believes he might trap her in the Akasha system, forcing them to double their efforts. The Traveler explains that they're looking for Tighnari and she assists them in the search. When they arrive at the greenhouse, they run intoHaypasia, who believes that she had reachedParipurna Lifeand offers to show them what she saw, which the Traveler accepts.
The vision that Haypasia saw was actually that ofScaramouche's memory, much to the Traveler and Paimon's shock as they realize that she went mad, only for her to realize the same as she walks off. Nahida then senses that something's wrong and they run out, only to findCorps of Thirtymembers arriving to attack. While the Traveler tries their best to repel the assassins and rushes back to help her, Nahida is stabbed in the back by a spear, although the two manage to touch fingers, a small flash of light occurring on contact.
The Traveler suddenly finds themselves in Nahida's own body at theSanctuary of Surasthana, where they witness Scaramouche in the process of being made a god. When they come to back in their own body, they find themselves fleeing Pardis Dhyai with Tighnari, where Paimon reveals that he heard the commotion and helped them defeat the assassins. While the Traveler's consciousness was displaced into Nahida's body, Nahida had been swapped into theirs to help them escape â€” unfortunately, Nahida was captured by the Doctor upon swapping back, leaving her trapped in the Sanctuary with no means of controlling bodies remotely anymore.
Tighnari advises the Traveler to not give up, relaying the last message Nahida could leave behind, in code: "Even in a moonless night, a shower of starlight can still drown out illusions and lies." Recognizing that she once used "Starlight" to refer toThe Eremiteslike Setaria, the Traveler realizes that Nahida must want them to seek help from the desert folk of theGreat Red Sand. The Traveler then tells the two what they saw from Nahida's point of view; with two Harbingers in Sumeru, trouble is bound to happen. Tighnari also reveals that he went to Pardis Dhyai to monitor Haypasia's condition, as it was unusual compared to other scholars and that the matra would have dragged her toAaru Villageotherwise for permanent exile. He suggests they head toCaravan Ribatto reach the desert while he stays behind to help Haypasia.
Arriving at Caravan Ribat, the Traveler and Paimon remark about theWall of Samielwhen Alhaitham appears and tells them to follow him, narrowly escaping a group of Eremites who were hunting them down. Alhaitham tells them that he's still studying the capsule and believes the Traveler might be hiding something from him before offering to go to Aaru Village with them, which they accept.
When they arrive at the village, the Traveler sensessomeonewaiting to attack and parries the first strike before they clash with Alhaitham to a standstill. Alhaitham recognizes the man as Cyno, the General Mahamatra.Cynodemands he reveal the Divine Knowledge Capsule before Alhaitham questions him being alone in the desert, as the other matra were wondering where he went. Suddenly,Dehyaarrives and tries to mediate, although the two men are still insistent on fighting. A sandstorm then kicks up, forcing the group into the village chief's hut whenanother womancalls out to them.
Inside, the woman introduces herself as Candace and warns them not to cause a fight in the village again before asking them to explain what happened. Cyno goes first, stating that he put himself in exile after noticing missing data that Azar submitted himself. When he tried to investigate, Azar denied his request, stating that he had no right to judge them. Cyno then reveals that Alhaitham had been tasked with tracking the Traveler, who doesn't deny the accusation, but reveals that he did not accept it, as the sages had promised him divine knowledge, which he found extremely suspicious. Dehya then explains that she was just bored and wanted to return to the village, just as they hear growling outside. Candace leaves the house to handle the monsters.
After some time passes, the Traveler and Dehya worry about her condition, so they head out and find her fighting someriftwolvesand join in, repelling the enemy attack. The village chief,Uncle Anpu, then arrives, explaining that the Village Keepers have gone missing recently with no trace. Cyno explains that they're actually the exiled scholars of the Akademiya, as they believe that their crazed ramblings would give a negative psyche to others. Cyno then asks the Traveler to meet him elsewhere for a conversation.
At the arranged spot, Cyno explains the history of the Village Keepers; they were initially shunned by the village due to not being useful, but when an earthquake struck one day a mad scholar crouched to the ground with a green light radiating from him, protecting the entire village from any damage. The Traveler believes this to be the Dendro Archon's work, which Cyno believes and is surprised to learn that the Archon walks among the people. Just then, a boy namedIsakappears and asks them to help find his grandpa.
Returning to the chief's house, Cyno confirms with Candace about Isak, who explains his past to them. Isak is delighted to learn that they'll be searching for his grandpa, so they begin to look for leads.

TheTravelerandCynobegin their investigation on the missing Village Keepers by talking to some of the locals. After talking to them, Cyno overhears two others talking aboutKing Deshret's resurrection and confronts them. The two people,SharkanandMakan, are terrified of Cyno's presence and quickly spill everything they know, including their hatred for the Dendro Archon and that a "radical" was responsible for the missing cases. Cyno warns them not to warn the radicals beforeIsakbrings them to hisgrandpa'shouse, where the Traveler nearly faints from the aftermath of some incense.
Cyno then catches a whiff of the incense after concentrating and upon hearing Paimon mentionTighnari, tells them that he's a friend of his. After some further investigation around the hut, he discovers that someone else had come in and lured Isak's grandpa away with the incense. Returning to the village chief's house, Dehya suggests visiting her drinking friends atCaravan Ribat, but stops Cyno from coming along as she's worried he might intimidate them. Cyno and Candace remain behind while the Traveler accompanies Dehya.
As the two travel back to Caravan Ribat, Dehya expresses her hatred for the Wall of Samiel, explaining that its purpose of protecting the rainforest from sandstorms has been co-opted by the sages to also keep the Eremites out of Sumeru, as the sages simply take advantage of them, regarding the desertfolk as little more than tools or livestock to be exploited and discarded, "undeserving" of the Akasha's wisdom. At the local tavern, Dehya meets withZakiand tells him to letDelavarthat she has a spice deal for him. When Zaki takes them to the arranged spot, it is revealed to be an ambush, with both Delavar andEnguralso appearing. Believing Dehya to be an incompetent fighter, they are quickly surprised when she and the Traveler defeats them with ease before taking them back to Aaru Village.
The following night, Candace interrogates the radicals for information and they reveal that the Eremite band had met with a masked man claiming to be King Deshret's envoy, who gave them incense to lure the Village Keepers out. They would then meet at a junction where the man would take them away to an unknown location.Uncle Anputhen chimes in, but to ensure the radicals wouldn't learn anything, Cyno knocks them out. Uncle Anpu states that he believes the mystery man might be related to the Akademiya, as they approached him before to take the Village Keepers back, which he refused.
The group prepares to set out for the desert to find more information, while Candace stays behind to handle the radicals.
Before the group leaves, Paimon spotsAlhaitham, believing he had done nothing useful. Alhaitham tells them he had stayed in the village to continue his investigation and reveals that one of the villagers they spoke to had not been completely truthful to them. He explains that if the person had become too friendly to the Village Keepers, they could make themselves a target for the radicals. The group quickly realizes thatShanihad lied and return to her home to demand an explanation. Shani explains that she could hear screaming in the night, which Alhaitham confirmed with one of the village guards. After asking what was around the village, Shani tells them that there was an abandonedEleazarhospital nearby and they go there to investigate.
Arriving atDar al-Shifa, the Traveler eliminates the monsters camping outside. After Alhaitham unlocks the entrance, they wait for nightfall, upon which they hear the crying that Shani had heard. Alhaitham discovers a hidden entrance and after unlocking a few more mechanisms, they enter the hospital and discover a person inside, who Alhaitham recognizes asRazak. Alhaitham realizes that they might be too late, since there were traces that indicated a hasty withdrawal. He explains that the Akademiya's misinformation campaign made the radicals spring into action to unknowingly help in their plans while ensuring that no liability could be traced to them, reminding them of their encounter withMizriatPort Ormosas an example.
They take Razak back to the village, where they brief the others on what they found at the hospital. Cyno wonders how the Akademiya is aware of their plans before Alhaitham tells him that he's the mole, much to his anger. He explains that the sages knew of his conviction and that it posed a threat to them, so they needed to monitor him at all times. While he was idling about, Alhaitham found a book detailing his activities and movements which were uploaded to the Akasha on Jnagarbha Day. Cyno fails to see the reasoning behind it until Alhaitham tells him that the Akasha is capable of computation, thus it could predict his activities for the day. Cyno is initially dismayed at this, but realizes that if they were trying to avoid him, the perpetrators would go in the direction opposite of him; the desert.
Heading out into the desert, they find some headsets buried in the sand and continue following them, surmising that they were left there recently. Cyno then hears arguing and they spotDehyaand a group of Eremites led byRahman. Isak, believing Dehya to have betrayed them, confronts her, causing the others to follow up, much to Dehya's annoyance as she was trying to convince Rahman to aid them. Rahman refuses to accept Dehya's reasoning, so Alhaitham offers himself as a hostage, although he still refuses to accept the deal. Dehya asks Alhaitham if he'd uphold his promises, which he does. Dehya then asks Rahman if he trusts her, which he does. She then offers her right arm as payment for her friends' words, which Rahman accepts and orders one of his men to chop her arm off.
At the last moment, Rahman changes his mind, believing that cutting her arm off would be akin to cutting his own fingers and sees no point in hurting his own kin. He allows the group to leave, but demands a fight the next day to settle the score, which she accepts.
The next day, the group heads out to meet up with Rahman's group. However, they only find one of the Village Keepers, which Rahman states that it was a one-on-one exchange since he had reluctantly accepted the honesty of Dehya's friends. This angers her, who immediately charges and easily overwhelms him. One of Rahman's men then threatens Isak's grandpa, but when his hands start shaking, another scolds him for cowardice. The man then loosens his grip before realizing that it's an earthquake, but Isak's grandpa suddenly glows and protects the entire group with a barrier as the sands swallow them.
When the group comes to, they find themselves in somemysterious ruinswhich excites Rahman as the ruins belong to King Deshret. Rahman leaves his group to let them recover as he joins the others in investigating, where they find the Dendro Archon's power imbued in the ruins, which gets the group's attention due to the harmony between the Dendro Archon and King Deshret. After running into some runes, Alhaitham deciphers them, revealing the transcript to be fromKasala, the last priest of King Deshret. The transcript tells how King Deshret introduced forbidden knowledge to his people, causing them to go mad; to save them,Greater Lord Rukkhadevataused her own powers to give the people life. This was not without a cost, as King Deshret chose to sacrifice himself to prevent the knowledge from returning, while Rukkhadevata reverted to a small child.
Rahman is shocked by the transcript before realizing that he and his people made an enemy of their savior and accepts the truth. He apologizes to the group for his actions and promises to return the Village Keepers and share what supplies his people have after explaining to them what he saw. Upon arriving at his stronghold, Rahman brings the group to the perpetrators,MorghiandJudar. Upon seeing both Alhaitham and Cyno, they become terrified. The Traveler asks them if the sages were planning to create a new god, which they confirm, much to the group's surprise. They explain that since Rukkhadevata's death, scientific breakthroughs had been rare and on the decline. AfterIl Dottoreapproached them with the notion to create a new god, they accepted and began to set the plan in motion, with thedream samsaraand harvesting Divine Canned Knowledge from the mad scholars being part of the process to create their new god.
Returning to the village with the Village Keepers and the suspects, everyone agrees that what the sages are doing is completely unacceptable and begin to concoct a plan to crush the sages and rescue their true god.

As the day starts, theTravelerandPaimonfindCandace, who tells them that everyone is waiting. She asks has them promise that they wouldn't get too reckless before entering the village chief's home, where they catch up withAlhaitham,CynoandDehya. They formulate a plan before going off to finish up some last minute preparations. Alhaitham's plan involves taking action on the next Jnagarbha Day. Candace could tell that the meeting went along well and while she would remain behind to protect the village, she prays for their success.
Catching up to Alhaitham, he had just finished speaking withRahman. Alhaitham reminds them that they need to commit to the plan due to the serious circumstances involved. He then states that as a scholar, he could advise the mercenaries from behind rather than having to fight at the front. He also points out that he had not known of forbidden knowledge while working at the Akademiya and suspects that the scholars and mercenaries who used it fell victim to its corruption; however, the Akademiya treated it as something else, and he suspects that what is happening now happened in the past. Paimon tells him thatTighnarihad told them thatIrminsulwas connected to Sumeru's ailments and that they should informNahida, although Alhaitham fails to see the reason why until the Traveler explains it to him. This makes him conclude that savingLesser Lord Kusanalimuch more important, but before they could start, he needs to finish his preparations and they head off to Rahman's base.
Arriving at Rahman's base, they findMorghiandJudarworking, as Alhaitham had given them something to do. Paimon spots the headset from before alongside some Canned Knowledge capsules, causing her to become nervous. Alhaitham explains that they wouldn't be using them yet, but asks the Traveler to remind themselves of their conviction. As they wear the headset, Alhaitham asks them to simulate the successful rescue of Kusanali and that Sumeru's political landscape has changed. Paimon is still unsure as to his intentions before he explains that people have relied too much on the Akasha and thus they're slaves to orders. With his preparation done, he sends them off to Cyno atCaravan Ribatwhile he finishes up some other small tasks with the Akademiya scholars.
Making their way to Cyno, the Traveler finds him arguing with Rahman over the plan, as Cyno could not accept a plan with immense casualties. Rahman states that they don't have a choice and that it's their best option, but Cyno is still unconvinced, as he had gone to Alhaitham for advice. Rahman admits that he knows the ways of the desert before he explains the plan; using his capacities as aMatra, Cyno would work with the guards at the outpost to arrest Rahman's men, as they were unregistered and that the outpost would never accept so much Eremites at once, being their best bet to infiltrateSumeru City. Cyno states that Alhaitham gave him that suggestion and while he would ensure his men would not be hurt, the other guards wouldn't be as considerate and he is against meaningless loss. The Traveler offers to help, which both accept. Cyno, seeing Rahman's determination, decides to go with the plan.
Heading to the outpost, Cyno informs the guards that he's about to make a large arrest and needs their assistance in apprehending them. The guards go off to inform their superiors; as they do so, Paimon is worried that they might have been feigning support. However, Cyno reminds them of their discussion, in which Alhaitham believed that the guards at Caravan Ribat should be unaware that Cyno had stepped down due to his fellow Matra not knowing his current status and that if something happened to him, it would attract unwanted attention and potentially expose their master plan. Alhaitham also reminds the group of the Akasha's computation capabilities, although confident that it would be unable to discover their plan yet as they were all working together. Paimon is relieved before Cyno reminds her to pay attention next time as they hear footsteps.
The guards returned with their superior,Luxembarbo, who Cyno briefs on his mission and introduces the Traveler and Paimon as his assistant and their construct respectively. Cyno requests an elite platoon to set out in two days to apprehend Rahman's men. After two days pass, they meet up with Cyno at the outskirts of the village, where they find Luxembarbo and his men there already. Cyno reminds them that they need Rahman's men alive before they conveniently arrive on scene. After a brief struggle, Rahman and his men are arrested and taken away.
With no one to hear them, Cyno promises to get Rahman and his men into Sumeru City before asking them to proceed with the next part of the plan; assistingDehyain convincingTighnarito support them. While Paimon is concerned that he would not help due to not telling him the full plan, Cyno is confident that his relationship with Tighnari would get the message through.
Returning to Caravan Ribat, Dehya jokingly scolds them for being late. Due to the threat posed byIl Dottore, Dehya states that they'll need information on him before proceeding with their plan. The current plan involves heading toPardis Dhyaito find Tighnari, who Alhaitham and Cyno believe still have the Akademiya's trust, and thus use him to get as much information as possible to adjust their plan if needed.
Arriving at Pardis Dhyai, they find Tighnari and ask to speak with him privately. Learning that Cyno was working with them, he agrees to help out in any way possible while not asking for the finer details. When they ask him about Dottore, he tells them that the Harbinger had just left, having arrived to ask him to hand overHaypasiafor reasons unknown outside of working on her treatment. Tighnari refused, as he sensed an aura similar to that of other scholars. Dottore admitted that he would have dealt with him, but with theTsaritsacalling for his return, he had no time but remarked that he could finish up some loose ends before leaving.
Asking where he went, Tighnari points them in the direction he left in. Dehya uses her mercenary skills to track him and determines he's leaving viaPort Ormos. There, they find a large Fatui entourage before they hide in Wikala Funduq. However, Dottore spots and waves at them, causing them to realize that he had misled them and that they're going after Haypasia instead. Rushing back to Pardis Dhyai, they help Tighnari drive the Fatui off before checking on Haypasia. However, touching her causes a manifestation ofScaramoucheto appear, who tells them that their mission is futile as neither they nor Nahida can defeat him.
The Traveler asks why he's contacted them directly, to which he replies that he's just in a good mood. They ask some questions, stating that the Akademiya only sees him as a newGreater Lord Rukkhadevataand that the process to ascend him is risky. While Scaramouche notes their genuine concern, he states that he was always meant to be a god. He expresses his disgust for humanity, but when the Traveler points out that he could have cut his connection to Haypasia, he admits that he does have some affection for her, in that he saw her worthy to be his first follower due to seeing his past. The Traveler informs him of Dottore's intentions, but he believes it to be an attempt to sow discord and showcases his newfound power by causing lightning around Pardis Dhyai.
Worried about Dehya and Tighnari, they head out and find that Tighnari had been struck by lightning. Dehya states that the weather took a change and tore most of the Fatui. Tighnari states that he'll be fine, but notices that the Traveler looks concerned. Heading in the greenhouse, the Traveler informs them of their encounter with Scaramouche. Dehya takes this as their plan being successful, as Dottore had left. She tells them to meet up with the group at the Grand Bazaar at the appointed time.
The next day, the Traveler meets up with Alhaitham outside the Akademiya and asks for a rundown of the plan again. Alhaitham states that they'll be infiltratingAzar's office to access his console, as there should be a way to free Kusanali from theSanctuary of Surasthana. As Jnagarbha Day is important for the Akademiya, Alhaitham states that they'll just head straight in through the front door, much to Paimon's astonishment. Once they enter, they're met byViraf, who questions the Traveler's arrival, only for Alhaitham to tell him the reason should be obvious as he walks off.
Further inside, they head into theHouse of Daena, where they lay low to ensure they wouldn't run into Azar in the process. However, Azar intercepts them, having been informed by an eyewitness. He takes them to their office, stating that due to Jnagarbha Day, he has little time for small talk and asks why they came before detaining them. The Traveler warns him of the Fatui's motives, but he pays no attention to it, being interested only in their new god. Alhaitham gives him information on the Traveler, leading the two to believe he had betrayed them. However, Azar calls Alhaitham out on his own plan. In an apparent fit of insane rage, Alhaitham drops the Divine Knowledge Capsule and lunges at Azar, but misses, although he knocks over a rack of Knowledge Capsule on Azar's desk before the guards apprehend him. Azar orders him to be exiled to Aaru Village before locking the Traveler and Paimon up, confident that with the Traveler out of the way, the sages' plan would be set for good. As Alhaitham is dragged away, his Akasha reverts to green, revealing that his "insanity" was just a ploy and he shares a glance with Nilou as they pass by her.
In the confinement room, the Traveler and Paimon go over the plan again, as Alhaitham's 'betrayal' has set the Traveler in the best position available to wake Nahida from the Akasha. They manage to find a spot with a stable connection and connect to Nahida's consciousness. They initially have trouble connecting to Nahida, as she has self-doubt over her capabilities as an Archon, but after hearing anunknown voice, is convinced to do her best. The Traveler breaks a barrier surrounding her and manages to wake her up. With Nahida's consciousness awoken, the next part of the plan begins.
Outside,Sheikh Zubayrasks Nilou if she really intends to go with the plan, which she affirms. Zubayr concedes, but warns her to be careful, as the few people of the Bazaar might be unable to help her. Nilou makes her way to the Akademiya, where she performs at the entrance. Azar orders the guards to detain her, but when the order is uploaded to the guards, they're instead told that Kusanali escaped into the city and are ordered to apprehend her. Alhaitham had planned for this possibility, thus leaving the Akademiya without guards, allowing Dehya and the Eremites to go into action. DressingIsakas Kusanali, they lure the guards into the Bazaar and defeat them.
Back at the Akademiya, Azar wonders where the guards are whenUdayarrives, having done what he was told. Azar checks the Akasha himself, discovering the order but wonders how it got there in the first place. When Uday questions the Akasha, he unintentionally angers Azar, who goes to the Sanctuary of Surasthana to investigate. When he arrives to confirm the information himself, he runs into Cyno, who demands that he plead guilty to the archon herself. Meanwhile, Dehya frees the Traveler from the confinement room and tells them that the plan was a success.
Heading into the Sanctuary, the Traveler and Paimon meet Nahida in person for the first time. Nahida apologizes for putting them through situations she caused, but they decline the apology as she wasn't at fault. Now knowing the full extent of the damage, Nahida reverts the Akasha to be used by herself only and revoke all of the sages' access, make them pay for their crimes, and also to stop the false god. She advises them to prepare themselves.
Inside, Nahida remarks on the intricacy of the Akasha before giving the Traveler an "upgraded" version which she made just recently and would help them in their travels. She also reveals that she discovered the false god's location. She also intends to support them, as she doesn't have enough power to fight yet. Needing to connect to Scaramouche's consciousness, they enter the facility, which had been made by the Fatui. As they head deeper into the facility, Nahida could sense that Scaramouche was either nearing or already became a god. When they finally reach him, they find him in a large mechanical suit and that he sees himself as a god, although Nahida notes that the sages weren't able to infuse the Divine Knowledge Capsules into him and that he lacks the spiritual height of one. Nahida awakens him in order to get his attention before he challenges them to a fight as to reenact a scene of theArchon Wardespite Nahida's pleas otherwise.
Despite the Traveler's initial attempts, Scaramouche plunges his arm into Nahida's chest to grab her Gnosis, but Nahida reveals that he had been in a repeating samsara. Due to the samsaras, she proceeds to impart the combat knowledge to the Traveler to put them on better fighting terms, alongside compiling the knowledge of Sumeru's people with the Akasha to the "upgraded" terminal, allowing them to defeat Scaramouche. Nahida proceeds to grab the Electro Gnosis from the mechanical chest, causing Scaramouche to fall out as he begs for Nahida not to take it from him.
Using the Electro Gnosis alongside her own, Nahida and the Traveler enter Rukkhadevata's final memory, although she is surprised to see it severely contaminated. The Traveler explains the concept of forbidden knowledge to her, which she connects toKing Deshret's time and also thecataclysm. Nahida clutches in pain as the corroded consciousness is affecting everyone, so set out and find a boat to take them to Rukkhadevata's lucid consciousness to find the answers they seek. When they arrive, the Traveler recalls seeing the same place when they first arrived in Sumeru before they meet a replica of Nahida, although it is Rukkhadevata's consciousness.
Nahida has many questions for Rukkhadevata, who reveals that she created Nahida from the purest Irminsul branch to serve as her incarnation in the 'next samsara'. Rukkhadevata states that to save Irminsul, Nahida would have to erase her from it, which would remove all traces of her having ever existed on Teyvat. Nahida is upset at this, but regretfully complies. As Rukkhadevata is removed, Irminsul is restored, which in turn allows the people of Sumeru to dream again and removes the forbidden knowledge completely. Returning to the real world, Nahida and Paimon have forgotten about Rukkhadevata, but as an alien being, the Traveler has not; as the Traveler contemplates telling Nahida the truth, they suddenly fall asleep.
Dottore then walks in, having waited too long to speak with Nahida in person and that he simply used a sound wave to put the Traveler and Paimon to sleep, having correctly surmised that it would not affect an archon. He reveals he came to negotiate, but also reminds her that she can't fight him. Nahida admits this, but threatens to destroy the Electro Gnosis, which in turn could potentially awakenCelestia. Dottore falls for the threat, but Nahida, knowing that Ei's Gnosis would bring disaster to Sumeru, agrees to give it to him as long as he destroys his other segments. Dottore states that he spent many rare resources making them, but agrees and eliminates them all. With the deal made, Dottore inquires about her Dendro Gnosis, reasoning it has no use now that the Akasha is going to be shut down. Dottore offers her information about"the skies of Teyvat being fake"in exchange for her own Gnosis.
The Traveler regains consciousness atGandharva Ville, with Paimon waking them up.
Catching up with Collei, the three have breakfast before finding that Nilou had left them a letter. Opening it, they discover that she's invited them to a celebratory feast as Cyno had returned to his original position as General Mahamatra. As they meet up with Tighnari, the Traveler learns that Cyno had brought them to Gandharva Ville to recover, although he was unaware that a feast was being held in his name. The Traveler invites the two along, but they decline, as the Forest Rangers have been much busier as of late. Tighnari also reveals that Azar and the other sages were sentenced by Nahida to spend the rest of their lives inAvidya Forestto cultivate wisdom after hearing that Nahida had defeated Scaramouche and restored Irminsul.
Returning to the Grand Bazaar, Nilou tells the Traveler that she had also sent invitations to Alhaitham, Dehya, Dunyarzad, Rahman and Cyno and asks them to look for them to confirm that they got the invitations. Heading into the House of Daena, they find Alhaitham arguing withKaveh, who had just returned from the desert to discover that the sages had been overthrown. As Kaveh leaves to confirm it with others, Alhaitham notices the Traveler. He remarks on the absurdity of the situation they had just navigated and that he had rejected an offer to become the Grand Sage, as he did not like being a leader. The Traveler informs him of the feast and he agrees to come.
Heading to Port Ormos, they find Dehya and Dunyarzard, the latter relieved and delighted that all the Eleazar cases were dealt with. Dehya states that she intends to quit serving as her bodyguard, as she always intended to do if Dunyarzard was cured, wanting to return to her mercenary life. She asks them if Alhaitham told them about considering working for the Akademiya, which they were unaware of. Paimon asks about the invitation, although the two had not been aware of it but thank her and agree to show up. Asking where Cyno and Rahman were, Dehya tells them that they were likely at Aaru Village.
Arriving at Aaru Village, the pair catch up with Cyno just as Rahman andSetariaarrive. Setaria reveals that she intends to leave the Akademiya, but continue her studies so she could enrich the well-being of her people, who had been neglected by the Akademiya. Due to Nahida's manipulationearlier, Setaria resolved to return to the desert and was going to confront Azar when she found that he wasn't there, only for Cyno to inform her that he was gone. Nahida, wanting to put the people of the desert on par with the rainforest, devoted many supplies to help out, but Cyno had to contact Rahman's men to get them distributed. Cyno then learns about the feast in his name and agrees to come, while Rahman and Setaria decline as they're too busy.
With all the guests confirmed, the Traveler returns to the Grand Bazaar two days later in the evening as the feast goes underway. Noting that everyone had forgotten about Rukkhadevata, and now believed Nahida to have been the Dendro Archon all along, the Traveler decides to keep her memory a secret to honor Rukkhadevata's last wish. After talking to a few people, Nahida connects to the Traveler and uses them as a channel to speak with the rest of the group, thanking them for saving her and all of Sumeru. The group is humbled by her presence before she arrives in-person, bringing the feast to its climax.
The following day, the Traveler returns to the Sanctuary to speak with Nahida, who answers their questions about their next stop,Fontaine, and its Archon,Focalors. Nahida also reveals that theirsibling, despite not originating from Teyvat, was recorded in Irminsul as suddenly appearing inKhaenri'ah. According to the information in Irminsul, the sibling began traveling across Teyvat after the cataclysm. However, the records surrounding the climax of their journey are fuzzy, leading Nahida to suspect that someone was intentionally withholding information about their fate. Nahida also reveals that the Fatui had classified them as Teyvat's fourth "Descender," a visitor from outside Teyvat. She suspects the first "Descender" to be the Heavenly Principles, but is unsure as to who the other two were, leaving both with many questions. Nonetheless, she promises to help them with their inquiries, hinting that she may appear in their dreams.

CaribertTraveler's Quest ActQuest TypeChapterArchonIIIActVIPreviousNextAkasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame RisesPrelude of Blancheur and NoirceurRequirementsAdventure RankRequired35
Caribertis the sixth act inChapter IIIof theArchon Quests. It involves theTravelerandDainsleifmeetingKaeyabriefly inSumeruand discovering a strange hut inAvidya Forest.
Wandering aroundPort Ormosafter sunset, the Traveler and Paimon run intoMasrur, who hands them a letter from a "crafty fellow" who used a loophole to guarantee that his letter was delivered to them. They read it and find that the letter was from Kaeya, who was stopping at Sumeru and asks to meet up with them atDjafar Tavernin the afternoon. When they arrive, they find that Kaeya had his fill of all the drinks. Paimon wonders as to what he might be doing in Sumeru, believing that as a Captain of theKnights of Favonius, he should be back inMondstadtand thatJeanwould be upset. Kaeya states that he had come to scout outSumeru's alcohol industry, as the tavern itself was home to a special concoction made with spices.
After the Traveler points out that he's alone, Kaeya admits that he had been to Sumeru before but it brings up bad memories. The Traveler tells him that he doesn't have to go into detail, so Kaeya tells them that in his youth, he had heard Crepus discussing sending merchants to Sumeru. Knowing thatKhaenri'ahwas situated under Sumeru and yearning to learn more about his roots, Kaeya stowed away amid the merchants cargo, only to be brought back to Mondstadt by the ear when he was caught.  They ask him how much he knows about the nation, and he admits that he only knows a little from reading books, and as he spent less time in Khaenri'ah, he began to care less about it and wondered if his father wanted him to live happily in Mondstadt. As Kaeya remarks that his last name, Alberich, is the last thing tying him to Khaen'riah, Dainsleif inexplicably appears and asks him what he knew about the name.
The Traveler and Paimon are surprised by Dainsleif's appearance while Kaeya greets him, having sensed him listening in onto their conversation. Dainsleif then states that Kaeya's ancestors, the Alberichs, are the founders of theAbyss Order, leaving everyone surprised. Kaeya expresses surprise at the revelation before recognizing Dainsleif as a pure-blooded inhabitant due to his primogem-shaped eyes. Paimon wonders if Kaeya was working for the Abyss Order, but he does not answer that, saying the conversation steered into too serious a topic. Kaeya then takes his leave, since he had a spice merchant to talk business with.
As Kaeya leaves, Paimon remarks that the relationship between Kaeya and Dainsleif appears to be tense, comparing it to oil and water. Dainsleif tells her that he doesn't know him well and wonders if Kaeya is being honest about his relationship to the Abyss Order. The Traveler inquires as to the founding of the Order before Paimon asks what he's doing in Sumeru. Dainsleif states that while recovering, he remembered something related to the "Loom of Fate" operation, which theTraveler's Siblinghad mentioned when he was traveling with them in Sumeru and thus is trying to find the place they had gone to together inAvidya Forest. Paimon decides to go, but Dainsleif waits for his drink before they do so.
Arriving at a small farming field, Dainsleif finds the area familiar and they investigate. Paimon worries about rudely intruding, but Dainsleif senses that no one had been around for years. With few leads in the field, they check the hut and find no leads inside either. Dainsleif then hears something outside, where they discover a group ofSlimes. After eliminating them, Dainsleif decides to investigate the nearby Ley Lines alone, concerned that something had attracted the monsters. Paimon is worried, but Dainsleif states that the hut is the main investigation and thus the Traveler and Paimon set up a campfire for the night. Paimon asks about the Traveler's sibling, and the Traveler responds that they had frequently looked together at the stars, pointing out planets they wanted to visit, and shares that their stop at Teyvat marked the first time they had been separated. Paimon volunteers to take watch, so the Traveler falls asleep and dreams of their sibling.
The following morning, the Traveler wakes up to find Dainsleif greeting them. Reminding them of their task, he then notices that they must have dreamed of their sibling due to their tears and lets them be.
When the Traveler fully wakes up, they hear noise coming from the house and investigate, only to find an intimidating man scolding them for intruding into his business. They inquire about Paimon, who tells them that she had left for the forest too. When the man tells them to leave, the Traveler refuses, believing he's hiding something and that they have no chance of finding Paimon in the forest. The man admits that he was worried about them being related to the Forest Rangers or Akademiya and allows them to do as they please. When he decides to go inside, the Traveler insists on following, where they find him with ahilichurlwith a bandaged wound.
The man explains that "he" was too young to suffer such a fate before the Traveler realizes the man is from Khaenri'ah. He demands an explanation and the Traveler explains that they knew based on his features. He then asks them if they believe in a god, which they don't. The man then introduces himself as "Eide." He explains that there are few humans who follow no gods and considers those who do to be his enemies. As he rants about the gods and their "gift" that ruined Khaenri'ah, the Traveler asks why some were turned into hilichurls and others were not. Eide explains while only one bloodline founded Khaenri'ah, they welcomed all humans who did not follow the gods. Those considered pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were deemed the "greater sinners" and given the curse of immortality, while the others were given the curse of the wilderness and transformed into hilichurls.
The Traveler asks about the hilichurl, and the man introduces him asCaribert, his illegitimate son that he had with a woman from Mondstadt while he was unsatisfied with his life as a noble. The Traveler asks him about Caribert's mother, but the man does not disclose anything as he finds it too painful before he remembers what he was going to do and goes out. The Traveler catches up with him and finds him at a crafting bench, where he reveals that he was creating a potion with materials only found in Sumeru to make a temporary cure. Eide asks for someSumeru RosesandKalpalata Lotus, with the Traveler assisting and making themedicine. However, it has one more step; to get the blessing of one of the Seven, which Eide finds hard to do but eventually goes with it.
With the medicine fully prepared, they administer it to Caribert, but it has no effect, leaving Eide angered. The Traveler believes that it wasn't enough so they decide to make more. Eide has them fetch some water to grow the strange mushrooms used in the remedy. He then states that he has to leave and asks the Traveler to not let the Forest Rangers discover the place as he makes the fertilizer. Instead,Fungiappear, which the Traveler repels. As they prepare another dose of the medicine at the Statue of The Seven, Eide notices Caribert leaving and they chase after him.
Following the hilichurl, Eide realizes that it is not Caribert as it lacks the scarf which he gave him as a gift. Nonetheless, the hilichurl's behavior was unusual and the two decide to follow it to an unknown sanctuary, discovering hilichurls praying to something. Investigating further, the two are greeted by astrange being. The Traveler recognizes it as a being of the Abyss, but is not a member of theAbyss Order. The Traveler defeats it, after which Eide expresses awe at the being's power and how the Traveler easily defeated it. When they reach the end, they find a strange object hung midair and realize that it was the same as theDefiled Statuethey encountered before. The Traveler warns Eide to leave, but turns to see Eide suddenly bowing as amysterious voicethat calls itself a "sinner" begins to speak. As the voice leaves, Eide regains consciousness, awed by the experience. Disturbed, the Traveler insists that they leave and they return to his house. After receiving a second dose of the medicine, Caribert regains consciousness, but is somewhat horrified at what he became. Eide tells him that they're in a fairy tale and under no circumstances he is to take off his mask.
Believing that the voice from the strange sanctuary saved his son, Eide returns to it pray, not believing the Traveler's claims that the god was actually a "sinner."
Worried for his safety, the Traveler returns to the sanctuary to help clear any monsters on the way. When they return to the spot where they'd heard the voice, the statue is nowhere to be seen, and neither are any hilichurls. Eide decides to return his house, believing they would meet the strange deity again. When they arrive, they discover Caribert missing and the mirror broken on the floor. Worried that he took off his mask and saw himself in the mirror, the two try frantically to track him, running into someForest Rangerson the way. After being sent in the right direction, they find Caribert imbued with the power of the Abyss as he takes his mask off, rendering the Traveler unconscious.
Once they regain consciousness, Eide reveals himself asChlothar Alberichand addresses the Traveler as his "Prince" or "Princess," causing the Traveler to pick up the mirror and see themselves as their sibling before falling unconscious again as Chlothar declares his intention to use the power of the Abyss to fight the gods. When they come to, they find Dainsleif and Paimon over them. Dainsleif states that the Abyss had messed with the Ley Lines in the area and he fixed it before the Traveler explains what they saw to the two. Upon digging the field, they find the remains of a man â€” which they believe is Chlothar, as he had disappeared 100 years after founding the Abyss Order â€” and a woman. Dainsleif then states that they have to part ways for now, as "he" may have seen the Traveler, referring to the "sinner" they had seen in the vision. He has his suspicions as to who this sinner is, but needs time to confirm their identity and he'll know who he is for sure in their next meeting as he leaves. The Traveler then hugs Paimon.

Arriving atCaravan Ribat,Paimonreminiscences about the first time they arrived, helping freeNahidafrom the corrupt sages of theSumeru Akademiya. As they prepare to go off toFontaine,Dehyaarrives and greets them, who had just finished a commission to transport some goods. She asks them what they were planning to do, and when the Traveler mentions going to Fontaine, a Fontainan looks at them with suspicion. Dehya expresses dismay that the pair will be leaving but remembers that they were traveling, so she offers to have some mercenaries escort them to the border between the two nations, though they kindly decline. Dehya admits that she finds it hard that the real heroes would leave quietly, but wishes them luck on their journey. After finishing up their own business in Sumeru, the Traveler and Paimon walk up to the edge of a desert cliff to seeRomaritime Harborin the distance.
Once they arrive at the port, Paimon is amazed by the advanced technology and the two briefly talk about what to do in the nation. The Traveler suggests they meet the Hydro Archon right away, with Paimon wondering what her personality would be like after Nahida mentioned that she had a "unique personality". Seeing two locals nearby, Paimon suggests talking to them to get information about the Hydro Archon.RenaandEtiennetalk about the recent trial at theCourt of Fontaine, the former explaining that it is similar to an opera house. When Paimon worries about the trials not being taken seriously, Rena tells them that withNeuvilletteand theOratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinalecreated by the Archon, false charges and injustice were a thing of the past. Paimon then asks them where they could meet the Hydro Archon, and Etienne tells her that their archon, LadyFurina, basically lives there. Rena correctly deduces that they want to talk with her and tells them that the process is much more complicated, as she's wildly popular by the people and anyone wanting to see her would have to make an appointment in advance.
The Traveler deduces that while the people of Fontaine like their Archon, they do not revere her. As Paimon suggests they spend the time exploring the city, the Traveler spots a girl by the edge of the port and decides to check on her. The girl remarks about a memory in the past, but the area it is associated with is now submerged and she mysteriously states that they will be, too. Before they could go on, her brother appears, thanking them for taking care ofLynette. He then introduces himself asLyneyand Paimon explains that Lynette was talking to them. This surprises Lyney, who explains that she usually keeps to herself. Paimon asks about Lynette's mysterious statements, so Lyney explains that there is a prophecy going around in Fontaine. He then formally greets the pair, shaking hands with the Traveler and patting Paimon on the back. Learning the reason for their visit, Lyney offers to take them to the opera house.
As they make their way around, they are instead greeted by Furina and her entourage, surprising Paimon. Furina directly addresses the Traveler and Paimon, aware of the disruption they caused in other nations but nonetheless welcomes them as the nation's Archon. She then asks them if they have the qualities to communicate with her as the person from before bows, having informed her of their arrival. The people believe that the Traveler had come to duel her, so the Traveler draws their sword.Clorindeprepares to intercept, but Furina has her stand down, commending on their bravery to stand against a god. As a normal duel would be too predictable, Furina instead declares that they will have a 'duel' in court, surprising the Traveler and Paimon as they had only just arrived in the nation. Furina then points out that they had just broken a law by releasing a flying object on the first three days of a month - referring to Paimon, thus giving legal grounds to arrest them.
Lyney objects to the order on the grounds that Paimon is something else. Furina hears his claim, so Lyney snaps his fingers, revealing a red cord of energy tying the Traveler's hand to Paimon's back. He claims that this makes Paimon a balloon. Furthermore, the pair had arrived in the nation like this, making the charges unwarranted. Furina is entertained and drops the charges. She then leaves, expecting a good performance from Lyney and Lynette later on. Paimon is left baffled by the encounter, while Lyney explains that he had remembered such a law and made preparations just in case. He then reveals that he and his sister are having their first performance in the court, which serves as an opera house when a trial is not in session.
Lyney gives them a Magic Pocket and tells them more about the prophecy; everyone is born with sin, and not even the Hydro Archon could absolve them. One day, the water levels would rise in Fontaine, drowning the people and leaving the Hydro Archon alone, weeping on her throne; so that the sins of the nation could be washed away. Paimon asks to why the people are born into sin, but Lyney is not able to give a clear answer. Regardless, the people believed the claims to be baseless until recently when the nation's water levels began to rise. Thus, the Magic Pockets will allow people in the waterside to transport their belongings as they relocate.
After giving the Magic Pockets to nearby people, the two return to Lyney, who wanted to have the people prepared in the worst-case scenario. Before they could leave, he asks them to help gather someRomaritime Flowers. Once they do so, they spot a girl pickpocketing the people and concoct a plan to catch her. The twins move in as the Traveler cuts off the thief's escape route. Some time passes and the Traveler decides to check on Lyney, who had returned the stolen items. The thief fled, but Lyney hurt himself, forcing them to abort the pursuit. With everything finally resolved, they take the aquabus. Just as its about to pull out,Charlotterushes on.
Charlotte is surprised to see the Traveler and Paimon, not having heard anything about their visit to the nation. She introduces herself to Lyney and Lynette before discussing recent events, mostly a case with young women disappearing over the past 20 years with no resolution in sight. Once they arrive, Charlotte leaves for an interview. Then Lyney asks the Traveler and Paimon to follow him to their home.
Arriving at Lyney and Lynette's home, they run intoFreminetoutside the front door and ask him where everyone else went. Freminet tells them that everyone went out, prompting Lyney to state that "Father" was returning soon. Freminet then asks Lyney about something in private, after which he collects the materials for the Magic Pockets. Suddenly, the sky begins to darken and rain breaks loose, surprising Paimon. Lyney tells them that the weather usually changes when trials take place while Freminet looks at the sky. He tells Paimon he heard story that the Hydro Dragon used to live in Fontaine. While no one knew where it went, people believe that when it wept, the skies cloud up and rain.
The rain lasts longer than usual, so Lyney decides to finish some business and asks Freminet to take the supplies to the workshop. Freminet is too scared to go, being an introvert, so the Traveler offers to it for him. Arriving at Beaumont Workshop, they hand the items to Estelle. She tells them they don't have to pay, as Lyney did so in advance. Paimon is impressed by the machine she use. Estelle tells her that the machine runs on Indemnitium, a source of power made from the trials at the court. She then talks about another source of energy before being rudely interrupted byTruandand his lackeys from theConfrerie of Cabriere. As the Traveler tries try to leave,Childeunexpectedly appears and warns the group of their own debt toNorthland Bank. Paimon waves at Childe, surprising him. He says he was getting bored and their arrival meant things would get interesting.
Childe continues his talk with the Traveler and Paimon, angering Truand to the point that he and his lackeys attack. Childe easily overwhelms them, with the Traveler and Paimon serving as witnesses to his actions being made in self-defence. Truand then realizes that Childe is actually one of theEleven Fatui Harbingers, but Childe suddenly loses control of his Hydro weapons and they vanish. Truand takes the opportunity to attack, but Childe knocks him out with a single punch. The Traveler, Paimon and Childe wonder what happened, though Childe reasures them that he still has hisDelusionas a backup. Paimon asks what he's doing in Fontaine. Childe tells them that he has been in a bad mood recently and began to feel something stirring inside him. Paimon surmises that this might be the cause of his Hydro Vision weakening. Childe then tells them about his time in theAbyss, including his meeting withSkirk, who took him as an apprentice because he had "it" on him and her lessons would help in the future.
Childe then reveals that while he's been idling around in Fontaine, he's been sparring with their official Champion Duelists. Childe explains that before going to court, the accused are given one chance to redeem their honor in a duel against a Champion Duelist, but they are some of the nation's strongest fighters. If the defendant wins, the charges are dropped, but if they lose, they must go to trial, though some simply die and rarely anyone has ever been freed in such a manner. Childe states that he was about to spar with Clorinde. Then, in light of recent events, he gives the Traveler his Vision for safekeeping so that it doesn't get in the way of his duel, before leaving.
Heading to theFountain of Lucine, the Traveler hears a mysterious voice as Lynette appears to greet them. They ask her about the voice, so she gives them a theory about the tears that eventually flow into the fountain holding intense emotions. She then takes them inside the opera house to catch up with Lyney, believing a talk with him would allow him to cool his nerves before the big show. Inside, Lyney gives them tickets to the best seats before being called byCowellto handle the props. As they go inside to their seats, they find a man seated next to them, resulting in a long, awkward moment. The man then apologizes, with Paimon introducing herself and the Traveler. The man had heard about their travels across Teyvat and attempts to introduce himself, only for Lyney to come in and call him by his name,Neuvillette, being pleased to see he was going to watch his show. Lyney properly introduces Neuvillette to the two, even showing the seat at the top of the court which the chief justice uses. Neuvillette then tells the Traveler that Furina was trying to get their attention, so they look at her briefly, which he deems enough to satisfy her.
As the audience trickles into the opera, Lyney and Lynette begin the show. Lyney performs some small tricks before bringing in a water tank. He does a trick to make Lynette disappear inside the tank before she reappears outside, which entertains Furina and the guests. Paimon is left shocked at how he was able to pull it off. Neuvillette tells her that she should be focusing on the show and not the hidden tricks. Lyney then pulls out two magic boxes and uses a machine to "randomly" select an audience member. In the process Lyney has some difficulty in finishing the trick. While he successfully gets out of his own box, the audience member fails to do so. The water tank from earlier falls, crushing the box and leaving Lyney shocked. Neuvillette puts the entire opera house into lockdown. After a quick investigation, Neuvillette reveals that Cowell was found dead in the box and the girl from the audience has gone missing, making her the latest victim in the serial disappearances of women case. Furina then declares Lyney a suspect due to the circumstances involved. Neuvillette then asks Furina if she was going to press charges on Lyney, which surprises her. However, in order to please the audience, she ends up declaring a duel between her and the Traveler.
Neuvillette then declares a trial the following day, assigning the Traveler as Lyney's attorney, while Furina wonders what the Traveler would do in the trial. As everyone leaves, the Traveler and Paimon talk with Lyney and Lynette, who are relieved that they have their support for the upcoming trial.
As they go to collect evidence, the Traveler and Paimon speak toEsmond, who believes that Lyney is truly the suspect. Searching around, they begin to build up a case to defend Lyney. During the process, they run into a mysterious woman guarded by two men in black suits. She introduces the group asNavia,SilverandMelusof theSpina di Rosula, an investigation organization. Navia agrees to help, as she sees the trials as something more serious and her group is also after the truth behind the disappearances. After showing how they performed the magic box trick, Lyney and Lynette are escorted out. This leaves the Traveler, Paimon, Navia and her associates to investigate the tunnel under the stage that they used. During the investigation, the group discovers many irregularities and Paimon jots down notes. Navia suggests they go to collect their thoughts, but Melus tells them that they are now associated with the twins, so they cannot leave until the trial concludes. As the group needs some tea and snacks, Melus reveals a baking stove and Silver takes out ingredients, which Navia uses to make macarons. Paimon takes two extra macarons, but swears she's taken the same amount as everyone else. The trio then leave to collect more information, so the Traveler waits the following day for the trial to start.
The next day, Neuvillette declares the trial to start while both parties give their statements. When Lyney maintains his innocence, Furina points out that around the half-way mark, there was a loud thud and expresses doubt that he could not have heard it, surprising him, while the scales tilt in her favor. She then exposes them as members of from theHouse of the Hearth, surprising the Traveler and Paimon with their friends'Fatuibackground. This results in the audience supporting Furina's claims while she notices the Traveler is speechless, believing herself to have won. Neuvillette asks Lyney to confirm this, and he does, resulting in the scale dropping further towards Furina. The Traveler then requests a recess, which Neuvillette grants for an hour.
At the opera's backstage, Lyney expresses surprise that Furina would have dug deep into their past, while the Traveler and Paimon are upset by the deception and that they were Fatui members. The twins apologize for not being more transparent, but Lyney insists that he is innocent in this case. The Traveler agrees to help see justice served correctly, so Lyney begins telling them his perspective of the events - he wanted to investigate the Oratrice's core, but ended up retreating when a voice called out to him. When he got back into the tunnel, he saw the smashed vase and scattered clothes, though he could not give it much thought as the countdown was about to end.
Furina manages to regain some of the audience's sway after the Traveler is unable to deduce the full truth, but the Traveler then realizes that they need to go from another angle. They request to inspect Cowell's belongings, believing he may have used the water from the tank to take another form. Furina finds this absurd, as it's only a magic trick. However, Neuvillette agrees to the request so that the trial can progress. Esmond then comes in and reveals that Cowell's bag had labeled tubes of water from the Primordial Sea and that he belonged to an organization selling illegal drugs. Navia then realizes that something and leaves with her associates.
With the new evidence supporting Lyney's innocence, Neuvillette allows the Traveler to continue with their hypothesis, tilting the scales towards Lyney's favor. Furina, on the other hand, becomes worried about having wrongly accused someone, even agreeing slightly with their reasoning. Neuvillette then brings in Vaughn, having been informed of new evidence found; the same water was found in Lyney's belongings. Furina uses the opportunity to cement her claim, knowing that the Traveler has nothing to defend against it. However, before the sentencing can start, Navia bursts in with new evidence. She reveals the box from before and asks Lyney to repeat the trick. Lyney snaps his fingers and the missing woman from the audience reappears. She confesses to the entire crime and reveals that she was actuallyLiliane, not Halsey. She was the thief that the Traveler and Lyney were chasing at the harbor. She stole a ticket and came to the show to relax. She became terrified when the random number generator picked her and Lyney mentioning theFortress of Meropide(a prison), believing he was onto her.
Now relating the story in Liliane's perspective, the scales tip towards Lyney's favor, leaving Furina shocked and unable to muster any words. She admits defeat and Neuvillette puts the information into the Oratice, which returns a "Not Guilty" verdict to acquit Lyney and Lynette. However, Neuvillette does remark that both Lyney and Liliane's conduct should warrant additional investigation. Neuvillette then realizes that Vaughn was Cowell's accomplice because he previously presented false evidence to frame Lyney. Furina yells at him for deceiving her judgement and Neuvillette recommends he confess to everything and seek the protection of theGardes. Vaughn begins to confess to the entire plot, but before he could reveal the identity of the "Boss", he dissolves into water. Neuvillette orders another inspection on the entire audience, though no evidence is yielded.
With the case over, Lyney and Lynette talk to the Traveler again, thanking them for their help and apologizing for the deception. They explain that, as orphans, their goals aligned with the House of the Hearth and the Knave. After their parents died, he and Lynette were able to survive after watching a street performer's show. After being adopted by a noble, Lyney became horrified when he learned that she was being trafficked to another noble because of her appearance. He went to rescue her, but when he arrived, the Knave had already slain the noble, rescuing her and several others before offering them a spot in the House of the Hearth. Lyney reveals that the Knave, who is also known asArlecchino, believed in the prophecy. Thus, before she took theHydro GnosistoSnezhnaya, she would try to use it to save their home, Fontaine. Lyney apologizes again for the deception but promises to help should they need it.
As the Traveler prepares to leave the opera, Navia and her associates manage to catch up, believing that the whole case is not solved yet. However, she learns from them that they were only there to defend Lyney, not the disappearances case. Despite this, she decides to have a farewell meal atHotel Debord, which the Traveler and Paimon agree to.

Arriving atHotel Debord,Naviaorders food as the three sit at a table and begin to enjoy it. They talk about the disappearance case; due to the previous trial, they now know that there is an organization behind the disappearances, though unsure as to their motives. While Paimon laments the fact that they were close to finding out who they were, Navia expresses a lack of faith in the Garde, stating that they needed to look at the case from another perspective to gain more clues. Navia then asks them what they plan to do, learning that they wanted to speak withFurinaas part of their journey to find the truth of Teyvat, though the chance was lost after the trial. Navia then suggests less legitimate means, though the Traveler and Paimon shoot them down. However, this results in them getting an idea to talk to her while she's on break, since Navia believes that Furina was embarrassed after losing the trial.
Navia then notices that herFontawas gone, resulting in Paimon apologizing for drinking it. The Traveler and Paimon note that the Fonta tasted salty, so Navia decides to blacklist the hotel's Fonta should they return. She later sees them off, promising to help them with their requests should the need arrive.
Returning to theFountain of Lucinethat same evening, both Paimon and the Traveler hears a voice calling for Vacher from the fountain and walks towards it, the Traveler blacking out in the process. When they come to, they find themselves mentally connected with anOceanid, asking them about Vacher. The Traveler tells it they are not Vacher, while the Oceanid tells them that it has lost a lot of their memories while human, causing them to realize that they were one of the disappearing girls. The Traveler offers to find Vacher, but the Oceanid refuses, as their reunion has since long passed and that Vacher had no choice but to move on with his life. She laments the fact that she could not comfort Vacher as she was dissolving, but nonetheless is glad that they sensed her presence and tells them to tell Vacher to forget about her before sending them out, as Paimon was calling for them.
When the Traveler comes back to the real world, they immediately find Navia,SilverandMelusfighting a large horde ofClockwork Meka. During the battle, Navia spotsClorinde, and her assistance allows them to defeat the entire horde. Afterwards, Navia asks Clorinde how she managed arrive in time, who admits that she was following her because danger had been tracking her too closely as of late and wanted to honorher father'swishes, though this simply creates tension as Navia is still upset about her father's demise. Getting back to the point, Clorinde tells them that the mastermind behind the disappearances is very powerful and that their performance would certainly attract their attention. Navia asks her how the Meka were controlled, as the Gardemeks could only be operated by theMaison Gardiennage. Clorinde tells her that these were illegal meka, as they had no serial numbers when she checked them and likely served as a private force for some rich or powerful individual. She warns them to be careful, though Navia insists that they'll find the truth behind the matter.
As Clorinde leaves, Melus tells Navia that she could have tried to thaw relations, though Navia admits she finds it hard to do so. Paimon tells the Traveler that the Meka appeared after they fell unconscious, only for Navia and her group to save her. Navia credits Paimon for tipping her off, as Fonta is sweet, not salty, and recalled that the color of the Fonta she'd been served at the hotel had been off - she came to realize that it had been spiked with water from thePrimordial Sea, and Paimon had accidentally thwarted an assassination attempt on her. Navia also realized that the Traveler was in danger and came to their rescue. As Paimon had also been able to hear the Oceanid this time, they put together from what Lynette had told them that the Primordial Seawater she drank had raised her Hydro sensitivity. The Traveler then tells her about the Oceanid they encountered in the water, giving them a good lead. With the Traveler and Paimon volunteering to fully join Navia's investigation, Navia takes them to one ofSpina di Rosula's bases to stay for the night and discuss it further.
Heading into the sewers of the Court of Fontaine, the group catches up to Melus, who had gone ahead to prepare the night's accommodations. Navia admits that when her father was the head of Spina di Rosula, their funding was much better. Asking about her father, they learn from her that three years ago, her father, Callas, was accused of murdering his friendJacques, but rather than standing trial, he chose to duel to maintain his honor, only to die doing so. He had even refused to yield once he was sufficiently injured enough for it to count as a loss. Therefore, coupled with the death of her mother (who he had hidden from her also), she was resolved to find the truth, believing that the disappearance cases was tied to the murder. Melus reveals that the duelist who killed Callas was Clorinde, hence their strained relationship. Clorinde had let them know afterward that before the duel started Callas asked her to ensure Navia was kept safe, indicating that he was determined to die in the arena.
The following day, the Traveler and Paimon find Navia greeting them, who had sent Melus and Silver back to their headquarters inPoisson. She had spent the night trying to find out who Vacher was, but discovered that there were no public records of him at all. However, she decides that there is one place that they could never reach - the case file archives stored byNeuvillette, which would be their best bet to find more information. Despite having suggested it herself, Navia is hesitant about it but pushes forward nonetheless.
Heading to Neuvillette's office at thePalais Mermonia, the three are stopped bySedene, who asks the reason for their visit. Navia claims they came to archive information on a follow-up case, so Sedene lets them pass. They enter Neuvillette's office, with Paimon apologizing for the deception. Neuvillette does not mind and asks why they came, so Navia tells them that they were looking for a man named Vacher, who was a witness to the disappearance case. Neuvillette makes a thorough search through the files but finds nothing about Vacher. As they leave, he apologizes to Navia for Callas' death, resulting in her becoming offended as she knew he had no emotion behind his words and that even though he agreed that something was wrong with the case, he let the duel proceed. After calming down, she apologizes for taking her emotions out on him and leaves.
Outside, it begins to rain even though it had been sunny out just earlier, causing Navia to recall how it was raining the day Callas was convicted. When she confirms that it was also raining the night Jacques was murdered, the Traveler realizes that now knowing about Primordial Seawater, the real murderer might have been dissolved into water, and the rain helped to leave no evidence of their presence at the crime scene. Navia agrees, so they head to her headquarters inPoissonand catch up with Melus. There, Navia deduces that with her father's case, there had been a popular drink known as Sinthe, which with what they know now, she is certain was created with Primordial Seawater. Sinthe was popular for recreation, but the effects of long-term consumption describe the result of drug abuse and deeply affected the drinkers and their families. Callas, seeing the danger, banned it from his group which incurred the sellers' wrath. To learn more about the mastermind, he cultivated relationships with some of the vendors, such asJacques, who was ashamed of his work and eventually agreed to become his informant. During a banquet, Callas is assumed to have shot Jacques dead, though she now knows that a third party might have been involved as there were clothes lying around at the scene. Melus warns Navia that there was no shame in backing out of the case as their enemy was highly dangerous, but Navia insists on finding the truth.
Melus reveals that he had hidden more from Navia; Callas was diagnosed with an illness that left him with less than five years to live and that he had a contingency plan by exposing the dangers of Sinthe to the public - the group had targeted Navia as the next victim, but did not make an attempt on her life until now because their plans and motives would be exposed if they did so, as Callas would have had no reason not to reveal everything he knew in a court trial. Melus is confident that with the Traveler's help, she could uncover the truth for herself. He advises that they not storm their headquarters, as that was tantamount to war. Instead, he gives three potential suspects to investigate that he had weeded out over the past three years -Florent,ThierryandMarcel, but they first stop to check in with Jacques' family, who had stayed in Poisson ever since Callas had taken them in.
Collecting evidence, they discover that Jacques' betrayal was noticed by the higher-ups in his organization and his wife believes he was forced to kill Callas, but struggled with the order. They also learn that Callas was off on the day of the murder and that when he left the banquet to get some air outside, he had left his gun inside, ruling out the possibility that he had a second gun on him to kill Jacques. When they meet up with Thierry, she asks him about the Gardemeks that attacked her. He tells her that they were nearly impossible to modify without keeping a secret and that either someone rich and/or powerful could get their hands on private units. Finally, they meet up with Marcel; while he does not recall the events during the banquet, he is willing to defend her.
With all the information collected, the Traveler concludes that Marcel was the likely suspect, seeing that he was the only one of the three to be wealthy enough to afford private Meka. Before they could go any further, Thierry urgently informs them that the authorities have accusedTartagliaof the disappearances. Realizing what's going on, the Traveler offers to infiltrate the enemy headquarters while Navia goes to the opera house to accuse Marcel and stall for time.
Heading underwater to the Sinthe production facility, the Traveler and Paimon arrive at the entrance and infiltrate it. Back at the opera house, Tartaglia is confused as to what he's being charged for but is willing to accept it if he could duel Clorinde again, as he was disappointed that she had held back in their sparring session. Before the trial could go anywhere, Navia barges in and accuses Marcel of being the prime suspect, referring back to her father's case. Neuvillette reiterates the official conclusions of the case for the record, which Navia refutes with the evidence she acquired. Furina asks for physical proof, which she does not have, but Navia states that it would be coming soon, while Neuvillette orders Marcel to court. She also reveals that she had been the next target in the disappearing cases, prompting Furina to ask why Callas did not want to defend himself. Navia explains that if Callas had done so, she and the rest of Spina di Rosula would have been targeted and many lives would have been lost. She then asks Clorinde to testify to Callas' state of mind in the arena, since she was the one who killed him.
Furina asks Clorinde if what Navia said was true, which she confirms; as a Champion Duelist, she could tell when someone was fighting to live or die, and that Callas wanted to die. Furina finds this as sufficient to open the case, but Neuvillette asks Navia to explain the link between her father and the disappearances. Navia states that on that day, the suspect would have had to attend both events and was willing to dissolve someone in water in front of many witnesses to protect their identity; coincidentally, Marcel was at both events. Marcel defends himself by stating that she was rushing headlong without sufficient evidence by proving where he was and pointing out he'd moved to Fontaine after the disappearances had begun, turning the scales in his favor. However, Navia pulls a trump card by mentioning Vacher, which catches him by surprise, confirming that he did know him.
Back at the Sinthe facility, the Traveler and Paimon begin to explore and fight through private meka units, reach the innermost sanctum and collecting evidence for Navia's case. They discover that Vacher was the one conducting the experiments. After collecting enough, they find the notebook of Vacher's lover Vigneire, containing Marcel's name. Vigneire had decided on it as the name for a future child they could have together.
Returning to the opera house, the Traveler accuses Marcel of truly being Vacher, inspired by the name of the child that never came to be and presents the evidence to Neuvillette, who asks Marcel to defend himself. Marcel does not, instead blaming the system for failing him as when he reported about the dissolving to the Garde, they simply laughed him off. He even drinks a large amount of the Primordial Seawater to prove it has no effect on non-Fontainians, and thus he couldn't commit suicide in a way that would reunite him with Vigneire. As he appears to show signs of mental distress, Neuvillette declares that Tartaglia is innocent and reviews the evidence provided by the Traveler, recollecting the entire event. He then submits the information into theOratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, which returns a "Guilty" verdict. Tartaglia prepares to leave, but Neuvillette stops him, as he has to be formally cleared from the charges initially pressed against him. Neuvillette puts the information in the Oratrice, which hands a "Guilty" verdict on Tartaglia, surprising everyone present, as it was the first time that it gave a verdict different than his own.
Tartaglia is unamused and attempts to escape using hisElectroDelusionand hisFoul Legacy Transformationtaking down several Gardemeks. Before he could fully transform, however, Neuvillette leaps from his seat and crashes down on Tartaglia, using an unknownHydropower to knock him out. As the Gardemeks apprehend Tartaglia, Neuvillette apologizes to him but promises to personally investigate the matter. Once the scene settles, the Traveler and Paimon talk to him about the verdict. He admits that it is the first time the machine had put him in a situation like this, but had to uphold the court rules nonetheless. Neuvillette suggests asking Furina, though when everyone stares at her, she becomes nervous and even shows signs of agitation before composing herself, claiming that the verdict was right and leaves to save face. Neuvillette assures the Traveler that he'll look into Childe's verdict on his own time and find the truth.
As the Traveler leaves the auditorium, they run into Marcel being escorted by Garde Esmond. Marcel asks the Traveler how they knew of Vacher, who tells them about the fountain. He asks to go to the fountain, which a passing Neuvillette grants as he accompanies them there. They then begin to hear Vigneire's voice and Marcel finds himself in the dream realm, witnessed by the Traveler. He meets the Oceanid, but it is not Vigneire, but instead the collective consciousnesses of the women he had dissolved and had merged with Vigneire, thus she knew of all of his crimes. The Oceanid tells him that Vigneire is avoiding him because of his actions and that she did not want him to come because they would kill him. The entire consciousness, including Vigneire, "drown" Marcel; in the real world, doctors rule his death as a panic attack.
A few days later, the Traveler and Paimon finish shopping in the rainy streets of the Court of Fontaine and cross paths with Navia. With her father's honor restored, Navia held a belated memorial for him with the rest of Spina di Rosula and made amends with Clorinde. She had decided to visit his grave and the Traveler asks to join her. When they arrive, they find Neuvillette there, who explains why he let the duel between him and Clorinde continue. He admits that he believed at the time that humans would prioritize their lives over justice, and if Callas was innocent, he surely wouldn't go so far as to let himself die for justice. To his sorrow, Callas had proved him wrong and that without his sacrifice, the case would have never been solved. After paying their own respects, the Traveler and Paimon asks Neuvillette several questions. He reveals that he had foreseen the possibility that one day he would conclude with a different verdict, and was prepared for such an outcome from the Oratrice. He promises to continue investigating Childe to prove his innocence and that Furina herself took the prophecy seriously.

Walking around theCourt of Fontaine,Paimonsuggests to theTravelerthat they take a rest at theSpina di Rosulabase underneath the city. A few days pass beforeIsadoraarrives, telling the two thatNeuvillettewishes to speak with them atPalais Mermonia. Neuvillette tells them that he has a situation on his hands, but wants the Traveler to get the full story first before deciding whether or not they wish to help him in the matter.
Earlier, Neuvillette asked Furina aboutThe Knavehaving requested a meeting with her, which he recommends to decline due to therecent eventsresulting inChilde's apprehension and detainment in theFortress of Meropide. However, Furina decides to entertain the Knave's request as she believes that they needed to explain their actions and expresses confidence in Neuvillette's assistance, though Neuvillette points out that it could make the matters worse, aside from his lacking social skills; nonetheless, he agrees to help.
Furina accepts the request and has the Knave arrive, who thanks them for their service to theHouse of the Hearthin part due to making the children's lives better. However, she came specifically for Childe and requests his custody, though Neuvillette denies it since the trial had already concluded. She then suggested entering the Fortress of Meropide to check on his condition, though Neuvillette tells her that the prison operates outside of the court's jurisdiction, but instead offered a proposal to her.
Back in the present, Neuvillette informs the two that things are even more complicated because Childe had also disappeared from the prison, though he is not sure as to where he went since there were no reports of him being seen outside the prison either. His proposal to the Knave was to have someone else investigate on her behalf, which she accepted with some hesitation. He can only turn to the pair as the courts have no jurisdiction to conduct any investigations at the Fortress, even if he does know the administrator personally. He needs a third party on the inside to secretly investigate Childe's disappearance, and as they already know him well, they may spot a clue that a stranger would miss. To enter the prison quickly, he would have to press false charges on them, which they accept. He suggests they enjoy some finer things ahead of time to prepare themselves for incarceration, and gives them aFruity Triocake sitting on his desk as thanks.
Arriving atCafÃ© Lutece, Paimon, having devoured the entire cake beforehand, eagerly orders several dishes from the menu in anticipation of only getting prison food whenCharlotteincidentally arrives. Paimon accidentally mentions that they're going to the prison, causing Charlotte to ask what they did. The Traveler manages to bluff their way out with the claim of a rather minor offence, though Charlotte asks them to help gather information aboutWriothesleyfor a new story, as he was given the rare title of "Duke" and that there's virtually no information about him. In exchange, she offers to pay for their meal, but immediately regrets it when the waiter returns withtwoloaded serving carts of food.
Neuvillette accompanies them to the prison's entrance, where he hands them off to the guards; the charges against the Traveler and Paimon are eating cake meant for Furina (the Fruity Trio from earlier) and that they are to spend 45 days in prison as punishment.
Inside the fortress, the Traveler and Paimon are escorted byDeakin, who explains about life in the prison, mostly theCredit Couponswhich serve as the prison's currency. When they arrive at the actual entrance, the three are greeted by a large number ofGardemeksand Wriothesley himself, who takes over the rest of the prison tour. During the tour, they run intoLyney, though he pretends to brush them off as an illusion. Finally, they head to the infirmary and meetSigewinne, concluding the tour.
As the two are led to the dormitory, the Traveler and Paimon talk about Lyney's presence, thus concluding that they too are also investigating the prison and resolve to meet with him the next day. After doing some work, they meet up with Lyney andLynette, who threw themselves in prison with a small "theft" performance to do so. Lyney, not wanting to hide any more secrets following hisprevious experience with them, reveals that the prison hides a secret and that "Father" was able to confirm that Furina did not have theHydroGnosis, though they are unaware how she did so. Therefore, they should focus on learning about the "forbidden zone". As they have their meal,Vidocheads to them, telling them not to break any "hidden rules" and that they should speak to him when they get more coupons.
Once their meal is finished, the two return to the dorms and sleep, while the Traveler has a flashback of Childe's time in the prison.
The next day, the Traveler informs Paimon of the dream they had of Childe. They decide to learn about the "rules", exploring the facilities that the prison has to offer. During their investigation, they learn two of the "rules"; working for three days straight would result in being served mystery meat and that it was not allowed to bet on two fighters in a match. After acquiring all they could for the day, the Traveler realizes that they aren't related to Childe and take a rest.
Having acquired enough coupons, the Traveler and Paimon approach Vidoc and ask him about the "hidden rules". He tells them to avoid the pipes late in the night, as there are rumors of cannibals preying on victims and turning them into other "forms". They prepare to investigate the new rule after lunch, where they discover Vidoc missing, but other people nearby. They ask them, but are refused, leaving them suspicious.
Needing another angle, they instead approachFieldingand tell him that they have trouble sleeping at night due to strange sounds. He confirms this, having heard rumors from his colleagues that they happen during pipe-cleaning days they have every month, with one of them happening tonight. They then return to the dormitory and sleep, where the Traveler gets a vision of Childe and realize that he used the pipes to escape.
Following the pipes, they find the three people from before, who admit that the "hidden rules" were a farce to protect Childe. They had originally viewed him with disdain, but he proved them wrong with his strength and they decided to follow him. One day, he told them he had to leave as he heard that "voice" again, escaping through the pipes, though he had not returned for some time. They approach the entrance to where he left, but find it completely flooded.
With this new information, the Traveler decides to have Lyney askFreminetto help in the task. Paimon is puzzled as to Childe's behavior, but is confident that they'll get to the bottom of the situation in no time.

The following morning, theTravelerandPaimonwake up and just as they're deciding to use up someCredit Couponsto take the morning off, they find one ofLyney's cards left in their cell. Reading the card, they discover that the prison has their monthly "free day" off and to meet at the usual spot, as he has new information.
While making their way to Lyney, the two run into various individuals, such asLaveruneandCuistot, the "Bombshell Bros". They learn from them that getting theDuke'sattention is beneficial and that two people have been frequently visiting the infirmary. They also overhear several prisoners deciding to stay in the prison even after their sentences are over before meeting up with Lyney. Lyney reveals that"Father"knew thatChildehad initially come to Fontaine for personal reasons and they were tasked with finding his location. Therefore,Freminetwould be suited for the task, whileLynettewould continue gathering information and Lyney himself would assist Freminet.
Still needing more information, Lyney asks the Traveler to help infiltrate the infirmary by feigning illness, though they get no relevant information fromSigewinneor the two people,JurieuandLourvine. During next few days, the Traveler collects information and passes it to Lynette, preparing for their meeting with Lyney.
On the ninth day, the Traveler meets up with Lyney, who reveals that Lynette had also feigned illness to acquire more information from the infirmary as sending the Traveler again would be too suspicious. However, when they arrive, Lynette is nowhere to be seen and the bed she was using tidied, causing Lyney to become uneasy. They soon discover a paper and read the contents, learning that Wriothesley had known of their motives. Lyney, worried for his siblings' safety and not wanting to be separated from Lynette again after her kidnapping years earlier, decides to confront Wriothesley, against the Traveler's wishes, forcing them to follow him into the office.
Lyney heads to the administrative office and accuses Wriothesley of kidnapping Lynette and likely Freminet, though he appears to dodge the accusation, much to his anger. Wriothesley states that he simply locked Freminet out, knowing that he would not abandon his family. He offers Lyney a proposal; their safety would be guaranteed if he asks "Father" to come for a talk, since he did not like the Fatui intrusion in his fortress, though Lyney refuses, believing that he was trying to blackmail them. Wriothesley decides to end the negotiation for his afternoon tea, though the Traveler steps in on Lyney's behalf. Wriothesley hears the Traveler out, since they had come underNeuvillette's request and agrees to release them if they answer several questions of his.
Wriothesley questions the Traveler over the "hidden rules", starting with theProduction Zone. They deduce that the "strange meat" is actually Sigewinne's cooking, meant to help restore stamina to those working non-stop, but because of howMelusinesperceive differently, humans would believe it to be non-edible and thus avoid it. Wriothesley is pleased that someone acknowledges Sigewinne's cooking efforts, and then asks them about the strange red liquid. The Traveler deduces that the liquid is actually a newFontarecipe the company is market testing on the prisoners for consumer feedback, which was only accepted because Wriothesley had allowed it, and thus meant to teach prisoners how to spend their Coupons wisely. Wriothesley acknowledges the answer and then asks about the secret behind Sigewinne and the people in the infirmary, though the Traveler is unable to answer it as they had not covered it. Lyney suddenly snaps and charges at Wriothesley, alarming the Traveler, but before he could do anything, he is hit in the neck by a projectile. Sigewinne had come in and had shot a tranquillizer dart, which causes him to collapse before Wriothesley states that they have incoming guests.
The guests turn out to beClorindeand an unconscious Freminet who Sigewinne immediately inspects and deduces from his symptoms that he consumedPrimordial Seawater, shocking Lyney. Clorinde reveals that the concentration of Primordial Seawater had increased significantly around the prison and that Freminet had fallen ill when he tried to follow Childe's path. He had turned back the way he came and fell unconscious, but was close enough for Clorinde to rescue him without falling prey to the Seawater herself. Wriothesley explains that he only had the exit locked just in case Lyney tried to search for Freminet, as that would also have put him in harm's way, and Clorinde would not have been able to save them both in time. Sigewinne concludes from her examination that Freminet's condition is fortunately not critical, gives him a pill while Lynette arrives and the twins help get him to the infirmary, where he regains consciousness and warns the group of his discovery, recalling the events leading up to his near-death encounter. Learning that Clorinde had saved him, he decides to thank her in person. As she busies herself with Freminet's treatment, Sigewinne suggests they talk to Wriothesley for more information, while Lyney decides to remain behind with his siblings.
Returning to the office, the Traveler and Paimon ask Wriothesley to "enlighten" them about recent events. He tells them that he knew the children were all Fatui operatives at the start and originally believed they were sent to find Childe, but learned of Lyney's true motive during their work around the prison; he wanted to look into the "forbidden zone". Once he realized this, he intervened for both their and the prison's safety and that he had hired Clorinde for "work". He offers to take them to the "forbidden zone", which they accept.
Wriothesley takes them to the area, explaining that as administrator, only he was allowed to enter. When they arrive at the central room, they find a large sluice gate in the middle of the room, where he asks Paimon what she thinks the gate was for. Paimon makes some guesses, but Wriothesley tells her she's incorrect and explains the gate's purpose and the readings of a gauge on the gate. It had never moved when he first laid eyes on it, but it had slowly begun to increase in the past year into the red; coupled with Freminet's near-death experience, he concludes that the gate must be holding back the Primordial Sea from swallowing Fontaine and that it would eventually fail.
Wriothesley then explains about the fortress' purpose; when the previous Hydro Archon,Egeria, ruled the land, all the criminals were exiled with nowhere to go and shunned by society. Some of these people began to repent and beg for forgiveness, which she granted by having them guard her secret beneath the waves, which they did with the present-day fortress. Meeting up with Jurieu and Lourvine, Wriothesley reveals that after believing the Primordial Sea to be behind the gate, he had begun constructing a massive ship after being inspired by Remurian legend, though it had been kept secret from the rest of the prison as they would likely riot should they learn of it. Before they leave, he tells them that they had the option of informing Lyney and his group of what he just told them.
Returning to the infirmary, Lyney informs the Traveler and Paimon of his deductions through their information they acquired, which impresses the two as he was nearly right on every topic. They in turn then inform the three of what they learned from Wriothesley, telling them that this was no time to fight. The three siblings are shocked by the revelation but thank them for the information, with Lyney thanking them for saving his family. Paimon soon becomes hungry and they head to the canteen, where Sigewinne treats them to a delicious meal, having already led Clorinde there for the same reason.
Once the meal is finished, the two return to the dorms to sleep, only to be awakened by alarms and Cuistot, Laverune and others in a panicked evacuation. Cuistot informs them that they've been given orders to head upwards, away from the bottom. The Traveler realizes that the sluice gate was likely failing and they rush down to find Wriothesley, finding him with Clorinde just as the gate fails. Wriothesley manages to hold the waters briefly with hisCryopowers, though the pressure soon smashes through the ice. Clorinde then shoots a control panel withElectroto drop the security gates behind him before Wriothesley freezes the entire gate to stop the water from advancing. With a brief moment of respite, Wriothesley informs the Traveler to fetch Neuvillette, knowing that they would not be able to hold back the water for long.
Returning to surface entrance to the prison behind theOpera Epiclese, they find Neuvillette already coming, who asks them to watch Furina as she was in a meeting with the Knave, worried for her safety and agrees to head to the prison to deal with the growing situation. The Traveler and Paimon arrive at the meeting, diplomatically defending Furina from the Knave's attempts to pressure her. During the meeting, Paimon notices their cups shaking, making Arlecchino realize that they might be in the next stage of the prophecy.
Back at the prison, Neuvillette arrives and takes over the situation as Wriothesley and Clorinde retreat to safety. The gate fails and the Primordial Sea bursts past him, but he uses his powers to halt, and then push the water back and reseal the sluice gate, stating that the sentence was too severe for the people of Fontaine. Back at the party, Arlecchino drops the pleasantries and confronts Furina over the prophecy, accusing her of not protecting her people. Furina claims to have a primary and backup plan, though when Arlecchino questions her over it, claims both to be confidential. Arlecchino then asks about theOratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, as she wonders what the large amount of Indemnitium was going to be used for. She then notes that Neuvillette was not present and they change to less serious topics at hand before concluding the tea party, but asks the Traveler to see her off.
As they leave the opera house, Arlecchino thanks the Traveler for watching over her "children", confident in the siblings' judgement and abilities in the prison before asking what they thought of Furina. When the Traveler is not able to come up with their perspective on her, she decides to share her own. Learning of Childe's apprehension, she decided to meet the Archon in-person, knowing that he had given her an opportunity to do so. One night, she discovered Furina trying to play with a cat and attempted to take theGnosis, but discovered that she did not hold it before sensing a "curse" on her. Furina, believing that someone was trying to assassinate her, begged for mercy. Noting the genuine fear in her eyes and with no Gnosis, Arlecchino left. Her subordinates then confirmed that Furina was severely shaken by the "assassination" attempt, unable to sleep or even eat her cake. She then entertains the thought that Neuvillette might be the Hydro Archon and/or knew where the Gnosis was.
With Childe having gone missing from the fortress soon after, Arlecchino realized that she could diplomatically pressure Furina and Neuvillette for a meeting. Paimon is surprised that she would blatantly attack the Hydro Archon, though she reminds her that no one would believe the claim, as Furina herself seems to have not dared to tell anyone. She then tells them that she believes that Neuvillette is not the Hydro Archon either, as their behavior was not fitting of one given her time with theTsaritsa.
Neuvillette then arrives, prompting Arlecchino to take her leave, though she tells the Traveler that she would be happy to cooperate with them if needed. The Traveler then asks Neuvillette about what he did. He then remarks about mourning the recent turn of events, causing the area to begin raining. The Traveler then recalls what Freminet told them about the Dragon of Water before realizing that Neuvillette is actually the Hydro Sovereign. When he indirectly confirms it, he spots Furina stealing a quick glance at the Traveler before running off, distracting him before Paimon calls him back to his senses before confirming that he's the Hydro Sovereign, though asking them to keep it a secret. He then tells them about the dragons' past; when theFirst Usurperarrived on Teyvat, they took part of the Seven Sovereigns' power to create the Archons' Authorities. Paimon asks if he could stop the prophecy, of which he states that he would not be able to do much unless the Hydro Archon gave his Authority back to him and thus should look towards other solutions.
Returning to the fortress once more, the Traveler and Paimon talk to everyone they met, learning that the prison was faring fine after Neuvillette pushed the water back. With their mission for Neuvillette completed, Wriothesley allows them to leave the fortress at any time they wish, the use of their cell until their official sentence is finished, and even their free daily meal until then. He asks that they return to fill out the required forms when the 45 days are up. Upon returning to their cell, the Traveler and Paimon remark about their adventures and go to sleep.
Meanwhile, at the Primordial Sea, Childe can be seen drifting through its depths when he regains consciousness. He becomes shocked to find a massivenarwhalswimming right above him.

At theFortress of Meropide, theTravelerandPaimonwake up; aware that their "sentence" is over, they head out to sign the release papers withMonglane. During the process, the prison shakes, surprising everyone, so the Traveler decides to talk toWriothesleyto see if he knew anything about it. Wriothesley reminds them that the seal thatNeuvillettehadplaced earlierwould not fail, and if it did, the inmates would be in a panic; rather, the tremor came from the surface. After seeing the two off, they head to thePalais Mermoniato speak to Neuvillette.
When they arrive, the place is buzzing with activity;Sedenespots them, but as they're welcomed guests, lets them enter Neuvillette's office. Inside, they speak to Neuvillette once he finishes his work, informing him of thenarwhal-like entitythey saw fromChilde's Vision. He also wonders as to how he ended up in thePrimordial Sea, since people aren't normally able to enter it. They then ask him about the tremor, which he confirms happened inPoisson; after the tremor, the water levels rose quickly before they receded. However, he suspects that the water might have been related to the Primordial Sea and thus stays behind to form disaster prevention plans, asking the two to go in his stead.
The two arrive at Poisson where they find the city devoid of normal activity asSpina di Rosulamembers rush to aid the wounded. They eventually findNavia, who tells them that after the tremor, water began rushing out, soon revealed to be Primordial Water and dissolved everyone on the lower levels and causing panic to everyone else. The Traveler then realizes that people are missing and asks aboutMelusandSilver, but before she could answer, another member requires her attention. Once the situation is sorted out, she asks them to accompany her to herfather'sgrave. There, she breaks down, revealing that when she initiated the rescue plan, the two went to save people, but were caught in the waters and dissolved. She laments that she could not hold a funeral for them, as they had previously requested for her to bury them by Callas' side when the time came. Navia then hands them a list of the victims, which she considered fortunate for the costs. The two reassure her that she shouldn't see it that way and Paimon tells her to think of Melus and Silver as heroes, which she appreciates.
Arlecchinothen walks in to discuss the arrangements she made with her. As they were in the area, she had the Fatui lend them a hand in the relief efforts. Navia apologizes for testing Arlecchino, since she wanted to know who she was working with at the time, while also revealing that Arlecchino had set her subordinates to plenty of work with supplies, water levels and headcounts. Arlecchino sends her regards for Melus' and Silver's demise, but before she leaves, asks the Traveler for assistance. She reveals that theHouse of the Hearthhad learned that a child stumbled upon some ancient ruins near Poisson; as such, she had sent her subordinates for ruin exploration, but with the disaster on hand, had them assist in relief efforts. The Traveler accepts the task and Navia decides to tag along to keep her mind off her friends' deaths.
Arriving at the ruins, they quickly discover the area is flooded with Primordial Water. Paimon initially suggests that Navia head back, but upon realizing there isn't a path back, she decides to continue forward with them. As they walk across a bridge, it suddenly gives way. Navia slips and the Traveler turns back but fails to catch her as she plummets into the water. Navia then wakes up in Poisson with Melus and Silver, but she realizes something is off. The two then escort her to theOpera Epiclesewhere she is put on trial. The prosecutor,Joinville, declares her guilty and the audience demands she joins them, but Melus and Silver realize something is off and begin defend her. Navia then realizes that everyone present were victims of the disaster, but before the audience could take her, Neuvillette appears and dismisses them. Melus and Silver say their final goodbyes to Navia as Neuvillette brings her back to reality, where she relates her dream. Neuvillette explains that Navia fell into water from the Primordial Sea, but she was protected by two Oceanids just long enough for him to rescue her.
Navia is humbled that the two would continue protecting her even after death, while Neuvillette pulls the Traveler and Paimon aside as to give her some space. He reveals that he had come to Poisson to meet up with them. He was surprised to see the Fatui helping out and ran into Arlecchino, who told him where the group had gone. The four then continue exploring the ruins until they discover several stone slates on the wall, though the first one appears to be missing. Paimon reads the text, surprising her as it relates to the prophecy aboutFontaine's destruction. Looking at the second slate, they find several people kneeling while facing anisland in the sky. The third image shows Furina in the water, surrounded by people in the water, while the fourth image aligns with the prophecy of her alone, weeping on her throne. They then realize something is off with the order of the images and deduce that the significant person in the second image isEgeria, the previous Hydro Archon, who appears to be kneeling as if forgiveness for a sin. With no further leads to go on however, they leave the ruins. Navia leaves to check on her organization while Neuvillette goes to confront Furina about the prophecy. Navia has the Traveler and Paimon rest at their headquarters inFleuve Cendre.
When the two arrive, the Traveler and Paimon are treated to a large meal byTetreauxbeforeMonaspots them. Mona had come to Fontaine for some business and reveals her master's name,Astromancer Barbeloth Trismegistus. She insists that she is not a Fontainian, having been born inMondstadt. The two ask her about the prophecy, and it turns out thatThe Steambirdinvited her to join a panel about it. She expresses her inability to comment on the prophecy's "world-changing" claims, but states that the otherHexenzirkelmembers could discern it. The Traveler asks her to get in touch with her master for more information. Though surprised, she agrees.
The next day, the Traveler and Paimon head to Neuvillette's office to see if he gained any useful information from Furina. Upon arriving, Sedene informs them that the two are having an argument. Neuvillette asks Furina to stop dodging the question and he hands her a list of victims from the Poisson incident. Neither of them want it to happen again, so he pushes her to yield information about the missing stone slate and the prophecy from Egeria. Furina states that she and Egeria are two different people and thus she is not privy to her predecessor's secrets. She asserts that she has a plan in motion and orders Neuvillette not to speak of the incident again as she darts from his office, failing to notice the Traveler at the door. The Traveler then enters and Neuvillette explains that the only way to get the truth out of Furina will be to put her on trial. Even though he doesn't want to do this, he has no choice given the circumstances.
The Traveler contacts Navia,Lyney,Lynette,Freminet, andClorindeto meet up in Poisson with Neuvillette. There they discuss a plan to trap Furina and force her to reveal her secrets and deal with the prophecy. When the Traveler and Paimon return to Fleuve Cendre, they talk about their plan before someone sets a cup of tea down and joins them, though the person is nowhere to be seen. The Traveler quickly realizes that it must beMage "N"who tells them that even the gods' gaze has blind spots. The Traveler thinks about her words before going to sleep. When they wake up again, they find Mona, who had talked to Charlotte about the prophecy. They also tell Mona about N's visit, and she remarks that the situation must truly be dire for N to talk to them in person.
Paimon decides to take a walk around the city, where they stop atHotel Debordto get a quick bite to eat. Paimon notices the cake that was served in the tea party with Arlecchino and Furina and goes to order one, but Sedene suddenly appears and orders one too. Paimon asks her what she would do if the place disappears beneath the flood, and she answers that she would continue her routine regardless. Seeing that they're sad, Sedene buys two more slices of cake for them to lift their spirits. Then they go to the Steambird and meet up with Charlotte. Paimon also asks her what she would do if Fontaine were flooded. Charlotte states that she would still continue her work. While she could leave, she would be duty-bound to stay as a journalist and not forsake her homeland.
After walking around the city, Paimon and the Traveler stand beside the sea and she asks the Traveler the same question. The Traveler responds that they would continue journeying in Teyvat. The Traveler and Paimon spend the next few days in Fleuve Cendre beforeIsadoraarrives, telling them that there was a small-scale riot in the Opera Epiclese. During a show, some people accused Furina of ignoring the "prophecy crisis". Then, others began joining in, causing her to flee while theMarechaussee Phantomdealt with the situation. However, now that it was resolved, Furina was nowhere to be found. Knowing Furina, the two head to Poisson to look for her.
In Poisson, the Traveler and Paimon find Furina lamenting the victims of the recent disaster. When approached, she pretends she's fine before several people appear and chase her. The three manage evade their pressures before entering a house, where Furina begins to unravel and admit that she had been investigating the prophecy, but to seemingly no avail. The Traveler manages to convince her to open up to them as a "witness", since they are a spectator, not from Teyvat. But, before she could say anything, the house quickly collapses and reveals to be an elaborate opening act by Lyney to begin her trial. Furina finds the idea of being tried absurd, but Neuvillette takes this as a refusal. Since the other option is a duel with Clorinde, Furina refuses the duel by raising both hands up, surprising the audience. Furina then clarifies that she is not completely surrendering, rather she is agreeing to the trial.
The Traveler then prosecutes Furina, hoping to get the truth if they best her in court. Before they start, Furina asks how much time was spent to force her on the stage and learns of the plan to trap her. Navia's subordinates lured her both at the opera and at Poisson, while the Fatui built a "Giant Magic Box" to replicate Lyney's original trick and tunneled all the way to the opera house, where Clorinde was ready to duel Furina should she refuse trial. Furina then assumes that the Traveler was only intending to prosecute her, but they tell her that they wanted to give her one last chance to admit everything in the box. As the stage was already set, Furina states that the only action left for her is to begin the trial.
The Traveler presses the charge of Furina being a fraud, surprising everyone due to the blatancy of the accusation. Despite this, they manage to convince the audience through supporting information compiled by Charlotte's interview, culminating with Navia providing a sample of Primordial Water for her to touch. Furina is initially hesitant to touch the water, but does so to maintain her innocence. Neuvillette then calls Sigewinne in for a check-up, who reveals that she shared the same symptoms as other Fontanians exposed to impure Primordial Water. The audience is fully convinced and Nevuillette concludes the trial, deeming her guilty and leaving her in tears. Neuvillette then asks theOratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinalefor the final verdict. It declares theHydro Archonguilty, to be punished by the death sentence, even though the trial just proved that the defendant, Furina, was guilty ofnotbeing the Hydro Archon. Everyone is surprised and the verdict confuses Neuvillette greatly. Suddenly, Freminet appears with the missing first stone slate.
Neuvillette analyzes the slate and asks the Traveler to interpret it. They discover Egeria using her power to turn the Oceanids into humans, who became Fontaine's people. Using what they learned from the other slates, they deduce the truth of the prophecy. The people would be dissolved, turning into Oceanids, Celestia declared that the Hydro Archon and her people would be killed for her "sin", Navia's near-death experience was a "trial" meant to make her stay, and the eruption of the Primordial Sea at the Fortress of Meropide confirms that the prophecy would eventually be fulfilled. The Traveler gives their hypothesis of the prophecy, which impresses Neuvillette. He then reveals that there was another truth hidden, which he was unable to decipher at the time as they only had three slates.
In the Fontaine of old, Egeria's Oceanid followers yearned to live on land, but Egeria did not have the ability to create life herself. Thus, she used the Primordial Sea to grant them humanoid bodies by pouring it into their blood vessels. That is why, if Primordial Sea water made contact with them, they would "dissolve" back into their original forms. As she did not gain permission for this from the Heavenly Principles, the Hydro Archon had "sinned" by appropriating the power of the Primordial Sea. This revelation baffles the audience. Neuvillette then explains that the Traveler's hypothesis has some flaws. The third slate does show people in the water, but the water is not from the Primordial Sea; rather, it symbolized judgement and justice. Thus, the third slate shows how the people of Fontaine would put the Hydro Archon on trial, which they have just done. The fourth slate is actually a sign of things to come. The prophecy will be fulfilled by the massive narwhal-like entity seen in Childe's dream.
Suddenly, the ground shakes as a large rift opens in the opera house. The aforementioned massive narwhal-like entity emerges and Neuvillette briefly holds it off before it shifts its focus to the audience. Before it can consume them, though, Childe in hisFoul Legacyform appears and works with Neuvillette to push the creature back into the rift before he also tumbles back into it. Neuvillette, seeing the monster first-hand, realizes that the monster had roamed the Primordial Sea for ages and was responsible for the rising water levels. Once it consumed all it could, it would then target any remaining sources on Teyvat, namely, the people of Fontaine. However, its appearance had been delayed by Childe's efforts, though it would recover and return soon. When it did, it could not be stopped as it held the power of the Primordial Sea itself. Recalling N's words, the Traveler realizes there would be a way to fulfill the prophecy and save everyone at the same time. Then the Oratrice prepares to carry out its death sentence. The Traveler rushes to Furina and one of her tears lands on their hand, which sends Neuvillette and the Traveler into different realms.
Inside his alternate realm, Neuvillette encountersFocalors, asking her why she deceived them. Focalors explains that she did so to deceive the Heavenly Principles and resolve the situation thrust on her by Egeria. After much thought, she realized the only way to save her people would be to outwit their accuser, the Heavenly Principles. Focalors herself was also a transformed human, originally being an Oceanid. When she ascended as an Archon, she split her divinity, leaving her human body as Furina and her divine spirit as Focalors. Furina was everything she wanted as a human, but to maintain her ploy, Focalors cursed her. The "curse" she placed on Furina was that as long as her divinity existed, she could not die. She also could not live her life in the pursuit of happiness, and thus she was forced to play her role in the opera for 500 years.
The Traveler sees what Furina had gone through in the past 500 years while Focalors explains her plan and impending sacrifice to Neuvillette. As she executes herself, her Gnosis is returned to a shocked and grieving Neuvillette, while she thanks Furina for her role and wishes for her to live as a human. Neuvillette, with his full power restored, absolves the sins of all Fontainians. Thus, even when the prophecy will be fulfilled, the people will be immune to the dissolving effects of the Primordial Sea. Returning to reality, he tells the group that they can finally defeat the beast, since his authority as theHydro Dragonhas been fully restored. As the Oratrice is no longer functioning, he then asks the Traveler to accompany him as his executor.
Entering the Primordial Sea, Neuvillette and the Traveler subdue theAll-Devouring Narwhal. Before they can do anything else, a woman appears and uses a strange power to convert the beast into an orb before she hurls both it and Childe into a rift. She remarks on how her disciple and her "master's pet" began brawling. Paimon recognizes her asSkirk, Childe's master. Skirk is impressed with their strength, as they had defeated it without relying on the powers of the Abyss. They ask her about her master, who she callsSurtalogi, though they do not know that name. She then lists the names of others who she believes are a similar sort to Surtalogi, in that all of them are "pursuing some form of perfection." She then asks aboutVedrfolnir, who they fail to recognize, before asking aboutRhinedottir, who Paimon recognizes asAlbedo's creator. Skirk informs them that the narwhal used up all its strength and that the prophecy is now in full swing. As the waters flood Fontaine, the people are unaffected due to Focalors' deception and Neuvillette's absolution of primordial sin. The waters quickly recede, and a shocked Furina looks outside, seeing the people were unaffected.
With the prophecy averted, the people of Fontaine begin to rebuilding their society while the Steambird prints free copies to calm the masses and get them hooked on the inevitable follow-ups. Charlotte asks the Traveler to accompany her as she heads to Poisson to document the rebuilding efforts for said follow-ups. The rebuilding of Poisson is going smoothly with help from the Fatui and Clorinde, who was laying low there since her reputation skyrocketed after she challenged Furina to a duel. Once she finishes all her business in the town, Charlotte heads to the Fortress of Meropide for an interview withJurieuandLourvineabout the flying ship. Finally, they head toRomaritime Harborand catch up with Lyney, Lynette, and Freminet. Lyney tells them that "Father" was given the Hydro Gnosis and that Childe returned toSnezhnayato recover from his injuries. Paimon remarks on how they've allied with the Fatui for the first time. Then Arlecchino appears, surprising them. When asked, she states that as a Harbinger, it's her duty to hand over the Gnosis to theTsaritsa. The Traveler also asks her to returnChilde's Vision.
After seeing both groups off, the Traveler and Paimon look for Neuvillette, who's waiting outside theErinnyesentrance to the Fortress of Meropide. He tells them everything that happened and that with his fully restored powers, he deemed Fontainians "true humans", preventing them from being dissolved upon contact with the Primordial Sea. After some time passed, Furina abdicated from her role as Hydro Archon and left the related affairs (though not the title) to Neuvillette before leaving the Opera. Neuvillette promises to ensure that her needs are be taken care of. He also reveals that, after sending the two back to Teyvat, he spoke further with Skirk, who commented on his Hydro Gnosis, which she revealed was the "remains" of the thirdDescender. She recommended that he remove such "items of misfortune". Neuvillette tried to ask about this third Descender but Skirk insisted that she did not know. However, she promised to ask her master and have Tartaglia relay the information back to him. Neuvillette also reveals his full reasoning behind giving the Fatui the Hydro Gnosis to them.
With this information, the Traveler informs Neuvillette that they're the fourth Descender, leaving him impressed. They are still unsure as to what the Gnoses actually are, though they decide to ask Childe rather than make blind guesses. Neuvillette then ponders the gods' will and the difference between the rain that falls on everyone. He assumes the Traveler and Paimon will head toNatlannext, the land of endless war and a nation where both human anddragonscoexist. The intel gained from the negotiation with The Knave also reveals thatIl Capitanohas "thrown his hat" into the endless ring of war in there. Neuvillette suggests them to fully prepare themselves before going.

The Traveler realizes that it could be the key to solve the case. APyro Abyss Magesuddenly appears and attacks them. The Travelers wonders what theAbyss Orderis up to around the village and Atossa mentions that theHilichurlsaround Vimara Village has been more active lately and they always seem agitated.
Atossa heads back to the village as the Traveler and Paimon findDainsleif. Dainsleif is also investigating the Abyss Order and he suspects that they are up to something. The Traveler reminds Dainsleif about his promise to explain the mysterious voice from their last meeting. He reveals that the Sinner is "The Visionary"Vedrfolnir, who is his older brother and one of theFive Sinners of Khaenri'ah. The group consists of five highly esteemed and powerful individuals; Vedrfolnir himself, along withRhinedottir,Surtalogi,RerirandHroptatyr. He believes that if they had worked together with him, they could have stopped theVinster Kingfrom rocking the foundation of Teyvat, but instead they became allured by the power of the Abyss and shared a world-shattering power among themselves. Paimon recognizes Rhinedottir and Surtalogi, before Dainsleif explains that when the cataclysm came, none of them came to defend their nation, which he would never forgive and would always remember despite the erosion of his memories.
Dainsleif has been investigating theLoom of Fateoperation, the operation keeps going forward even without the eye of the firstField Tiller. He suspects that the Loom of Fate is closely related to theLey Linesand he decides to accompany the Traveler on the missing person investigation, seeing the possibility of someone existing only in memories.
The next day, the Traveler sees Dainsleif zoning out and seemingly agitated. He feels that memories of a person he never met before suddenly appeared on his mind when he woke up and Dainsleif is giving away the first Field Tiller's eye to this person in this new memory. He deduces that the missing person has something to do with Abyss Order and may have an ability to implant memories into other people and that the Abyss Order never stopped looking for the eye. Dainsleif takes them to the location of the eye to confirm if they still have it.
At the entrance, Dainsleif zones out again but quickly tells them to keep moving. The Traveler is curious of what did he wanted to say. Later on, he realizes that the Abyss Order is tailing them and that the fake memories is a trap for him to reveal the location of the eye. Sensing a disturbance in the Ley Lines, Dainsleif tells them to quickly leave the place and return to Vimara Village and this time they will have the opportunity to locate the missing villager. The Traveler thinks that something is off but they reluctantly do as he says.
After the Traveler and Paimon leave, theTraveler's Siblingslowly approaches Dainsleif from behind and holding a golden sword. Dainsleif reveals that he always knew that it was a trap but decided to go along with it for a chance to meet the Traveler's Sibling. The sibling had opted to confront him alone, as they knew that sending an army when the Twilight Sword was ready would spell their demise. The sibling further tells him that if they want to talk, he'll have to beat them first.
As the Traveler and Paimon explore the area surrounding Vimara Village, they notice that the previously agitated hilichurls are now unusually calm. Returning to the village, they ask about the missing villager, but to their surprise, no one appears to remember posting a commission related to them. The Traveler concludes that there are some flaws in the memory and find Atossa with a strange man. They quickly deduce him to beCaribert. Caribert realizes that they had seen him through their sibling's memory and was planning to say farewell to Atossa, but decides to leave her a message instead and asks them to follow him.
Caribert brings the Traveler to his consciousness, where they begin asking him about the Loom of Fate. He explains to them that while his father told him that he was the foundation for the Loom and that the person before the Traveler was just a memory. The Loom of Fate was a device that could create Ley Lines; in its primitive form, it could create and implant memories, but when fully unlocked, it could create Ley Lines of its own, losing its previous ability to create and implant memories, but could "change" the world. Thus, everything that happened in Vimara Village was of his own doing in order to have a "chance" at the life he was denied.
The Traveler decides to leave to help Dainsleif, but Caribert tells them that the Loom of Fate was completed. He explains that he had guessed how he would act; he had hidden the eye in his body in order to draw the sibling out, then give the eye to the Traveler while they left. This was never achieved, as Caribert had implanted a false memory of him giving the eye to them, thus explaining his distraction. While he has no idea what the sibling plans to do with the completed Loom, he wanted to make his own reality and fades away in peace, just as the sibling arrives.
The Traveler is delighted to see their sibling again, but discovers that they cannot physically touch them. The sibling explains that they did not belong in Caribert's memory and were thus intangible, and that they would be ejected soon. They share a short conversation, where the sibling explains their motives for continuing their war against the divine. They are in a rush to fully unlock the Loom before theHeavenly Principleswould awaken, as they did not do so despite the Divine Throne of Hydro being destroyed. They also express their loneliness to them, wondering if their actions were the right choice. Caribert's memory then begins to collapse, and the sibling informs then that they would not remember the conversation as they are separated.
As they awaken, Paimon explains that the villagers found them sleeping at the outskirts and were unable to wake them up, so they decided to bring them to the village. She also reveals that Dainsleif had come to check on them and that he had been seemingly injured and had a lot on his mind. The villagers then remember about the missing villager, Caribert, though realize that he had left with two others. The Traveler and Paimon then look for Atossa, who hopes that Caribert would return to the village one day. Paimon then asks the Traveler what happened after speaking to Caribert, but they are unable to remember before noticing something in their pockets, pulling out a picture of them, their sibling and Caribert, who urges them to get along with each other regardless of what happens.

Arriving atRomaritime Harbor, theTravelerandPaimondiscuss heading toNatlan. Paimon remarks that they hadn't seen a single human from Natlan despite having done so from Inazuma, and thus worries if Natlan no longer has a human population. Suddenly,Charlotteappears and takes a photo of them, having heard that they were about to depart.Navia,Clorinde, andFurinaalso arrive to bid farewell to the Traveler and hoping that their journey in Natlan would be uneventful. After the photo shoot, the Traveler and Paimon depart for Natlan.
At Natlan, Paimon remarks about the landscape and the many animals roaming the plains. The Traveler notices signs of human habitation and follows the road, hoping that they would encounter someone from Natlan and hopefully their Archon. When they come upona village, they find two adults talking to a child, who tell her they were leaving her team for the upcomingPilgrimage. The girl,Kachina, is upset, but allows them to go. The Traveler and Paimon then approach her and offer to help, though Kachina tells them that the Pilgrimage was only for natives of Natlan. However, seeing that they're stronger than they appear, she asks to learn from them so she can prepare herself while also offering to guide them around her village, which they accept.
On the way, they pass by a stage where several tribespeople are dancing, and Kachina explains how her people can align themselves to a rhythm. Later on, they run into herSauriancompanion,Ayo, and Kachina explains the relationship between her tribe, theChildren of Echoes, and theTepetlisaurus, their Saurian companions. Further down, they come across a large black stone, which symbolizes the tribe'sWayobbefore chiefPacalapproaches Kachina, surprised to see her there. Kachina introduces the pair as adventurers who are going to teach her a few things, causing Pacal to ask them to prove their identities; Kachina objects to this, but the Traveler understands that as she is a minor, he is only looking out for Kachina's safety. On Paimon's suggestion, the Traveler offers their handbook to look over which Pacal reluctantly accepts as he views theAdventurers' Guildas a "mixed bag". However, upon reading their names it's revealed that news of the Traveler and Paimon has reached Natlan and he's heard all about them. He apologizes for his mistrust and advises Kachina to learn well from them. Paimon then asks about the Wayob, and he explains that the Wayob determines who is worthy of inheriting theAncient Name, which is a sign of pride. Kachina is unsure as to why the Wayob had picked her as an Ancient Name bearer, but Pacal tells her to look toward the future.
With the registration for the Pilgrimage coming to an end soon, Kachina decides to head to the venue to register and tells them that they can expect thePyro Archonto be there in person. They stop by the localStatue of The Seven, and the Traveler attempts to resonate with the statue to gain the power ofPyro. However, to their surprise, the Traveler fails to resonate with the statue. Nonetheless, they show several of their elemental powers to Kachina, who is amazed that a person is able to use multiple elements at once. Walking further down the road, Kachina decides a break is in order and explains that the Pyro Archon is actually a human, much to the Traveler and Paimon's surprise. Kachina then notices aPhlogistonChisel and states that only people from Natlan could use it, but the Traveler activates it, much to her surprise. A large Saruian then appears, who Kachina recognizes as Toto. Toto lowers its head down, which Kachina explains is an invitation to ride on it, though she decides to stop right outside thecityto avoid tiring Toto.
A short walk later, the three arrive at the outskirts of the city whenK'uhul Ajawappears and begins scolding Kachina for being late and wasting his,Kinich's, andMualani's time. Kinich and Mualani appear, the former forcing Ajaw into timeout while the latter asks Kachina where her teammates are. Upon learning that she was ditched again, he remarks that a strong team or team leader for theteamstage won't matter when it comes down to individual strength in the end. Mualani points out that Kachina was very close to participating in the "Night Warden Wars" last time, and Kinich explains that the Pilgrimage is actually a test to see who is worthy to fight against theAbyssand defend their homeland. For this iteration of the Pilgrimage, five people will be able to earn that honor. Since Kachina no longer has teammates to help her, Mualani decides to ask if the Traveler and Paimon can join the Pilgrimage under special circumstances. However, she doubts it would be allowed, in which case she will instead pair up with Kachina while Kinich will step in to lead her former team.
While waiting for Mualani to break the news to her former teammates, the rest head to the registration site where Paimon notices several flags hanging, which are explained to represent the six tribes of Natlan. Kinich tells them that he is a member of theScions of the Canopyand that his people are close to theYumkasaurus. Kachina explains that Mualani hails from thePeople of the Springs, a seaside tribe, and that the other three tribes are theMasters of the Night-Wind, theFlower-Feather Clan, and theCollective of Plenty. Mualani returns and formally greets the Traveler on behalf of her people before they head to the registration site, where Mualani asksCivalif she could make an exception by allowing the Traveler to register for the Pilgrimage. Cival declines, stating that it would jeopardize the production of Contending Fire--only produced in battles between Natlanese--which is the fuel for theSacred Flamethat keeps the Abyss from invading Natlan.
Kinich further explains that only those bestowed with Ancient Names are sent to fight the Abyss, though non-name bearers who emerge victorious in the Pilgrimage will are still treated with the same honor as an Ancient Name bearer. TheOde of Resurrectiononly works on those with Ancient Names, and the Pilgrimage is meant to instill teamwork, as they have to emerge victorious against the Abyss, or they will die and their Ancient Name will be forsaken and forgotten. He also remarks that he has fallen several times and was brought to the realm of the Wayob, or the "Night Kingdom." Cival finishes registration and sets the teams, telling them that food and lodging is prepared for them. Mualani tells the Traveler and Paimon that everything was given courtesy of the Pyro Archon, and that friends and family can also benefit from it. They head to theWeary Innfor dinner, where they treat themselves to local specialties. Kachina is still nervous about the upcoming Pilgrimage, though Mualani and the Traveler cheer her back up. While she heads out to get some homemade fruit juice, Kinich tells the Traveler that Mualani is a three-time veteran of the Night Warden Wars and has never had to be resurrected. Mualani tells him that she hopes to share the victory with Kachina this time and boost her mood.
The next day, the group prepares to participate in the Pilgrimage while the Traveler and Paimon join the spectators in the stands. The first part of the Pilgrimage begins, with teams launched in hot air ballons to random locations and tasked with collecting Contending Sparks within a time limit. Kachina and Mualani work together to defeat some of the competition, allowing them to clear the stage. Mualani and Kachina are then separated for the one-on-one matches and placed in different lounges. During this time, two disqualified contestants,TepexpanandTamuin, attempt to threaten Kachina, believing she and Mualani had acted unfairly by catching them off-guard and defeating them in the team stage. The Traveler intervenes, and Kachina is reassured by the tournament staff that a loss is a loss, and that she should focus on her current matches. After a short break, she heads to the stadium, where she facesNkungaand defeats him, determined to participate in the Night Warden Wars. After a few more fights, she facesLiliuo. While she puts up a greater fight compared to Nkunga, Kachina defeats her, and Liliuo apologizes for taunting her earlier, acknowledging her strength.
Back at the lounge, Kachina thanks the Traveler and Paimon for their cheers as Mualani comes in, revealing that as they're very close in the rankings, she's her final opponent for the elimination round. Kachina is upset that she has to fight her friend, but Mualani accepts whatever outcome happens. Kachina prepares herself and heads back out to the arena. While she's still nervous, Mualani reassures her and they fight. Kachina comes out victorious with a surprise attack, and the resulting victory allows her to participate in the Night Warden Wars alongsideChasca,Iansan,Kaiulani, andKibangu.
While Kachina and the others head to fight the Abyss, Mualani decides to show the Traveler around Natlan just before Kinich arrives with the same idea. Since Mualani asked first, he relents and allows her to take them toher village.
The three arrive at Mualani's village and she prepares to send them to the hot springs, but they are stopped byAtea, who reminds her about the unwritten rule: outsiders must first acclimate themselves in the artificial springs before using the natural ones, to avoid scalds and burns. Mualani reveals that while Atea is a good friend of hers, she could not enjoy hot springs anymore after being impaled by an Abyssal monster. They later meet up with the chiefAminaand her guards, who were secretly organizing a party for Atea after witnessing her enter an abandoned hot spring. After a short soak in the artificial springs, served by Atea with snacks, they check on the party progress. Unfortunately, little was made, so Mualani brings the Traveler with her to show her around the village while also getting the necessary items to set up the venue. The setup takes longer than they anticipated, and they learn Atea volunteered for night patrol that night, so the party gets put off until the next day.
Mualani brings the Traveler and Paimon to the inn, where they resign themselves to a night of sleep. However, they are jolted awake when they hear cries in the middle of the night; the Abyss has emerged to attack the village, consisting of a fewriftwolf whelpsand Abyssal manifestations of Saurians. Defeating the few stragglers that entered the village, Mualani decides to talk to Amina to get a grasp of the situation. Amina tells them that they have confirmed one pylon in the area, but there could be more. Mualani and the Traveler head to the known pylon and destroy it, and the Traveler notices more monsters coming from a specific direction, which Mualani recognizes as the abandoned spring area. They head to the area to clear the pylon, only to find that Atea already destroyed it, albeit at the cost of sustaining severe injuries. As a doctor is called for, the Traveler realizes that she won't live that long and recalls the time they purifiedDvalin's tears when they were inMondstadt. The Traveler uses their purification powers on Atea's wounds to cleanse the Abyssal energy. This removes the mark from Atea, though the Traveler discovers that the old Abyssal contamination is too deep-rooted within her organs. They realize that she had been visiting the abandoned spring not because she had gotten better, but because she knew that her end was near, and they're unsure if they should inform Mualani of this revelation.
The next day, the party commences, but Atea is initially nowhere to be seen. She arrives a bit later and thanks the Traveler for their actions, though their silence confirms to her that they know she doesn't have much time left. She calls out to Mualani and has her and the Traveler come with her for a walk, where she reveals that she only has a few days left until her death. However, seeing Mualani in action reassured her that the tribe will be in good hands. She also hands the Traveler hertalisman, asking that it be given to the Pyro Archon when they meet again.

Chapter IFarewell, Archaic LordLiyue ChapterTraveler ChapterQuest TypeArchonPreviousNextPrologueChapter IIChapter Iis theArchon Questchapter set in the nation ofLiyue.
The God of Contracts, senselessly slaughtered as his people watched on in horror. In the end, he will sign the contract to end all contracts.
After being informed byVentithatRex Lapisis coming to Liyue this year to begin theRite of Descension, theTravelerandPaimonquickly rush toLiyueto meet the Geo Archon before he leaves.
Arriving atLiyue Harbor, the two just arrive in time for the ceremony. AsNingguangsummons Rex Lapis, he appears dead before the entire crowd. She orders theMillelithto apprehend all suspects, the Traveler included because they aren't from Liyue and they were too close to the center. The Traveler attempts to sneak out of the area, but on the way, accidentally steps on some glass and alerts the Millelith of their presence. A group of Millelith soon surround the Traveler, who draws their sword out. Before they can fight, ayoung Hydro userdefeats them. Taking them to safety, the young man introduces himself as "Childe", and asks if they metSignorainMondstadt. The two realize that Childe is also one of theHarbingersand become wary of him, but Childe insists that he is not here to fight and that he will tell them more when they arrive atNorthland Bank.
Upon making their way to the bank, Childe tells them in order to clear their name, they have to get the word of theadeptibefore the Millieth does, who are rumored to live atJueyun Karst. He gives them asigilto prevent the adepti from harming them if they become hostile.
At Jueyun Karst, the pair meet with theMoon Carver, who notices their sigil and asks what they are doing in the area. The Millelith then arrive, prompting the Moon Carver to ask the Traveler to remove them so they can continue speaking. With the guards routed, the Traveler explains that Rex Lapis was assassinated, much to the adepti's rage. Knowing that the Traveler is innocent of the crimes that the Millelith have accused them of, it tells them to seek out theCloud RetainerandMountain Shaperand theDemon Conqueror; the former two residing around Jueyun, and the latter inWangshu Inn.
The "Demon Conqueror" the Moon Carver was referring to is a young man named Xiao, who appears to be irritated by their presence and leaves. Speaking to the inn's boss,Verr Goldet, she tells them that Xiao is actually an adepti and enjoysAlmond Tofu, leaving the other dish up to them, which they decide to make aSatisfying Salad. She suggests they speak to thecheffor the special Almond Tofu. The chef however, is too terrified to create the dish, as a ghost has been haunting the inn. As the pair investigate, Paimon spots the ghost, terrifying the chef even further. With Goldet's advice, the pair follow the ghost, who ends up possessing a decrepitRuin Hunter. After defeating the Ruin Hunter, the ghost promises to stop haunting the inn if the Traveler continues to play with her. Upon telling the chef of the ghost's promise, he is relieved and creates some Almond Tofu for them.
With the tofu and salad on hand, they catch up to Xiao. They manage to stop him from leaving by offering him their food, and then tell him about Rex's death, which shocks him. At Paimon's request, he explains to them that the ghost is an innocent spirit who could not move on, so he asked the innkeeper and boss to take care of her for the time being.
With one of the three adepti found, the Traveler and Paimon begin their search for the Mountain Shaper. Arriving onMt. Hulao, they find amanbegging the adepti to give mercy to him and hisbrother. Mistaking the two for adepti messengers, he explains to them that they were going up the mountain when his brother became encased in amber. They find his brother and free him from the amber. The Mountain Shaper then appears, angered at the Traveler for freeing a "thief" and disturbing its mountain. Showing it the sigil, it then questions them to their presence and learns from them about Rex's death. It also explains to them that it planted many karst flowers to keep the mountain's tranquility, seeing everyone else as thieves and that those who stepped on the flowers would be encased in amber.
With the second adepti found, the Cloud Retainer is the last one to be found. Arriving atMt. Aocang, they find a stone table with food remains, which is meant to be food offered to the adepti. Looking around the area, they place some deliciousMatsutake Meat Rolls,Jewelry SoupandMora Meaton the stone table. Cloud Retainer allows them to enter its residence for the offerings, but will only meet them if they can navigate its domain. They are able to solve the puzzles and meet Cloud Retainer, upon which they explain about Rex's death to it. Cloud Retainer becomes enraged and vows to destroy Liyue for their crimes, but the Traveler manages to calm it down by countering with a "contract" of sorts with the food they had offered it, which it reluctantly accepts.
Now with all three adepti found, the Traveler returns to Childe and informs them of all that had transpired, who in turn tells them that the Liyue Qixing are refusing to let anyone see Rex's body. Paimon accidentally blurts out that they came to visit The Seven, which Childe immediately takes note of. He tells them that he can help them, but it will be some time in order to meet with his contact.
After returning fromJueyun Karst, theTravelerandPaimonreturn to theNorthland Bankand informedChildeof the adepti. Childe in turn tells them that theLiyue Qixinghave hidden theExuvia, but he has a contact that can get them in.Ekaterinatells them that he is waiting for them atLiuli Pavilion.
Arriving at the restaurant, Childe introduces the two toZhongli, a consultant of theWangsheng Funeral Parlor. Zhongli states that it is his duty to give Rex Lapis a proper farewell, as the adepti are slowly distancing themselves from the rise of mankind. Because of this role, he is capable of bringing the Traveler to the Exuvia. Although suspicious of Childe's intentions, he does not pry further and states that they must go to buy the needed funeral items, the first one being someNoctilucous Jade, having been provided themorafrom Childe.
The three visit theJade Mysteryand inspectShitou's samples. Although they only needed one sample of jade, Zhongli inexplicably tries to buy all three. However, Paimon stops him and suggests to re-evaluate the purchase. Zhongli is not bothered, but reveals to them how he can tell high-quality jade based on theirPyroaffinity. Returning to Shitou, he reluctantly chips off a small sample from all three of his jade. Although the samples are paper-thin, Zhongli states that they can always reinforce the interior withHydro. The Traveler recalls the massive cooking pot from the Meaty Tribe inDadaupa Gorge. The three travel there and use the cooking pot to test the jade samples, fending off the angry tribe due to ruining their food.
With the third sample proving to be of the highest quality, the three return to Shitou and buy the third jade from him. Shitou then inquires as to why they are buying the jade, upon which Zhongli explains to him of Rex's passing. Saddened by the Geo Archon's death, Shitou sells the jade to them at half price, which the Traveler pays off. They then leave the jade for the jewelsmith to forge.
The next items on Zhongli's list are some perfumes which are created from flowers. They meet withBolaiand ask for someSilk Flowers. Unsurprisingly, Zhongli does not have any mora on him, but after learning why they are buying the flowers, Bolai gives the flowers to them for free. However, he has no idea how to create the perfume, so he suggests speaking to some women around the city for advice, culminating with the Traveler making some withYing'er's assistance. With all three perfumes on hand, they return to Zhongli and offer the perfumes to theStatue of The Sevenoutside the harbor.
Zhongli then tells them that he needs theCleansing BellfromMadame Ping, but refuses to go with them under the pretense of having some business to attend to. They find Madame Ping in Yujing Terrace, who tells them that the bell is inside her teapot, which is actually a domain, making them realize that she is one of the adepti. They recover the bell and return to Zhongli.
With the rite nearing completion, Zhongli heads toGranny Shanand takes the kites he had commissioned. Granny Shan is one of the few who appear to care for Liyue's old traditions and appreciates Zhongli's compliments on how well the kites are made. Zhongli now needs some extra work done, so Childe gives the Traveler a bag of mora to get the needed workers. They negotiate withTic,TacandToeto get the requested services, before returning to Childe. Childe allows them to keep the remaining mora in exchange for some information, offering to leave the vaults at the Northland Bank open in return. Before Paimon could answer, the Traveler reflexively refuses to help him, which upsets Childe. Zhongli then walks in, unaware of the conversation, and states that they need to get someEverlasting IncensefromBubu Pharmacy.
Arriving at the pharmacy, they are greeted byQiqi. Learning that they want some Everlasting Incense, she requests their prescription, but they are not using it for medicinal purposes. Qiqi appears to be unaware of the Geo Archon's passing, stating that she will give them some if they help her hunt a cocogoat, which they'll need to use theGuizhong Ballistain order to do so. The three head toMt. Tianhengand find the disabled ballista. Zhongli recalls that there was a supply post nearby with spare parts, which they raid to repair the ballista. Doing so causes someTreasure Hoardersto attack the group, as they had disabled it in order to loot the surrounding area. They defeat the bandits but soon realize that there is no cocogoat, as the ballista would have detected it.
Returning to the pharmacy, they tell Qiqi that there is no cocogoat. She then takes out her notebook and realizes that she meant coconut milk, and the Traveler begins explaining how coconut milk is created. A man then appears and thanks them for taking care of Qiqi. Introducing himself asBaizhu, he learns that they want some Everlasting Incense and offers to sell it for three million mora, which they can't afford. The Traveler is forced to go to Childe for aid, who is amused by the story and agrees to pay for the incense and set up a supply of coconut milk for the pharmacy. As the group talks, Childe excuses himself and asks Ekaterina if she had heard of anything useful. She tells him that the Qixing have hidden the Exuvia at the Golden House.
Zhongli asks the Traveler about their opinion collecting the materials for the rite. Regardless of their response, he tells them to meet him at theThird-Round Knockout, a hole-in-the-wall tavern and he has brought mora to pay for the expenses. Arriving at the tavern,Iron Tongue Tiantells them a story aboutNingguangjust as a young woman appears, having found the Traveler. The woman introduces herself asGanyuand that Ningguang has extended them an invitation to the Jade Chamber. Zhongli tells them to go, as such invitations are rare, and that he'll be waiting for them atDihua Marshwhen their business with Ningguang is done.
Having received an invitation fromNingguangto theJade Chamberthrough theLiyue Qixing's emissary,Ganyu, theTravelerandPaimonsearch for a way there atMt. Tianheng. They initially find a mechanism and use it, but it does not take them as far as they expected. The Traveler then remembers theGuizhong BallistathatZhonglihad repaired while hunting for the non-existent cocogoat. Arriving at the ruins, they find theMillelithstanding guard outside. Paimon panics and believes that Ningguang had lured them into a trap, causing a fight.
The Traveler defeats the Millelith just as a young woman approaches and asks what is going on. Learning that the two "had designs" on the ballista, the Traveler tells her that they were looking for a way to the Jade Chamber. The woman then introduces herself asKeqingand realizes that they are Ningguang's guests. She tells them that the Millelith are here because someone had magically repaired the ballista in a single day, when it had been standing in disrepair for a long time. Keqing explains how to access the Jade Chamber and departs.
Paimon then remembers that they still need to give a gift to Ningguang per tradition, and suggests making a tasty slime snack. The Traveler obtains the ingredients and saves amanfromTreasure Hoarders. Grateful for the rescue, he sends word back to his boss to allow them to take some items for free. With a gift now in hand, they head to Yuehai Pavilion to ascend to the Jade Chamber, where they are greeted by Ningguang. She gracefully accepts Paimon's gift and offers one in return, before speaking at length about various subjects, including deities, archons, and theFatui. Paimon suggests looking at the board and finds a special paper, heading to some ruins where they find evidence that the Fatui were researching the Sigils of Permission.
With the business at the Jade Palace wrapped up, they meet up with Zhongli atDihua Marshto continue preparing for the Rite of Parting. Zhongli tells them that they need wildGlaze Lilies. While searching for the flowers, they encounter Ganyu again and discover that she is one of the adepti, having watched over Liyue Harbor since its inception 3,700 years ago. After hearing her thoughts aboutRex Lapis' passing, they return to Liyue Harbor, only to find it in chaos.
The adepti and Qixing have finally confronted each other directly, and at the same time, Ningguang has started cracking down on the Fatui. Zhongli learns fromFelixthat the Millelith have begun questioning theWangsheng Funeral Parlordue to their ties with the Fatui, prompting Zhongli to leave the Traveler to assistHu Tao, but not before telling them to look forChilde.
Realizing he must have gone to theGolden Housein pursuit of theExuvia's corpse and theGnosisamidst the chaos, the Traveler heads there and duels him. During the battle, Childe manages to get close to the Exuvia and plunges his hand into its chest, only to come up empty-handed. Childe mistakenly believes they have the Gnosis and demands they relinquish it to him; as the Traveler does not have it, he take it as a refusal and prepares to fight them. During the fight, the Traveler manages to force him to unleash hisDelusionand then hisFoul Legacy Transformationtechnique. Despite his advantages, he is ultimately bested and returns to normal. He remarks on how he only realized just now it was impossible for them to have the Gnosis and howSignora's report on them was completely off, but does not inquire into the latter further.
Switching to his backup plan, despite his distaste for it due to involving innocent bystanders, Childe releases the Sigils of Permission the Fatui replicated to summonOsial, an ancient god that Rex Lapis had sealed underneathGuyun Stone Forest. In the face of this new threat, the adepti and Qixing put aside their differences to fight the common enemy.
To fight Osial, the group uses Guizhong Ballistas replicated by Ningguang, with Cloud Retainer, Mountain Shaper and Moon Carver manning them. As they do so, portals open and release Fatui subordinates onto the platform, intent on destroying the ballistas. Keqing leads the Millelith, while the Traveler is blessed by Xiao, Ganyu and Madame Ping. They manage to repel the Fatui assault, upon which the three adepti on the ballistas fire a powerful shot at Osial, but it does not flinch and destroys them and the platform in retaliation. Xiao narrowly saves the Traveler in the process. With no other choice, Ningguang decides to sacrifice her Jade Chamber, using its massive weight to crush the ancient god into the bottom of the ocean.
With the threat dealt with, the adepti and Qixing settle their differences and the Rite of Parting proceeds as planned. However, this still leaves one question; whereisthe Geo Archon? The Traveler seeks out Zhongli and finds him atNorthland Bank, speaking to none other than Signora and Childe. He reveals himself as not only the Geo Archon but also the one who instigated the entire series of events, starting with his supposed assassination at the Rite of Descension, as a test to see whether Liyue could continue without him. In exchange for a yet-unknown ultimate goal, he forged the "contract to end all contracts" with theTsaritsa; satisfied with the outcome, he hands his Gnosis to Signora. The two Harbingers and former Archon soon leave the bank.
Sometime later, the Qixing host the Rite of Parting, which the Traveler attends as they overhear rumors about the battle against Osial, the Fatui's involvement, and hears the official story the Qixing came up with to explain Morax's demise. Keqing, grateful for the Traveler's assistance in stopping Osial, asks them what they would like as a reward; to her surprise, they simply ask to help put up missing posters for theirmissing sibling. After talking to several attendees, they speak to Zhongli about Liyue's future. Zhongli, aware of the Traveler's plans, tells them that the next nation,Inazuma, has been sealed off and its archon,"Baal", has issued aVision Hunt Decree, surmising that his "death" will cause her to advance her plans even further. He tells the Traveler that although the nation may be shut off for the time being, they should not give up and try to find a way in.
After theirbrief travelwithDainsleif, the Traveler and Paimon head to theAdventurers' GuildLiyuebranch, where they findGanyuandLan. Ganyu explains that theTreasure Hoardersare attempting a heist on theAbyss Orderand came to the Guild to post a commission as the Qixing are too busy, so the Traveler accepts it.
Heading to the ruins, they make their way inside and find aDefiled Statueof Barbatos hanging upside down, along with the deceasedGrand Thief. The area starts shaking soon after, causing Paimon to panic and tell the Traveler to flee. As they near the end, anAbyss Heraldintercepts them. After a brief scuffle, the Herald teleports away.
Outside the ruins, they find Dainsleif, who is surprised to see them. The Traveler then tells him about the inverted statue and the deceased thief. Dainsleif had never heard of an inverted statue before, but due to the Traveler's description of it, knows that it is tied to the Abyss Order in some way. He then proposes to catch up to the Abyss Order, so they find several groups aroundJueyun Karst. After defeating them, Dainsleif begins talking aboutKhaenri'ah, upon which part of the Traveler's memory regarding the fallen nation returns.
Dainsleif talks more about Khaenri'ah, explaining that it was a nation without gods; not because they were killed, or that they abandoned it, but because it never had one in the first place; human civilization flourished at a very advanced pace; but around five centuries ago, that nation was destroyed by gods. Dainsleif reveals that theRuin Guardsare just the modern names: they were originally called Field Tillers, powerful mortal weapons, and after the destruction of Khaenri'ah they wandered aimlessly spreading throughout all of Teyvat.
After defeating moreAbyss Mages, they find a talisman, which Dainsleif begins to translate. It is revealed that the first phase of the Abyss Order's plan is aboutOsial, who the Traveler had fought along with theLiyue Qixingand theadeptia while ago. The Abyss Order is planning to attach Osial's limbs to the Defiled Statue, and use the eye of the first Field Tiller in place of the orb that the Statues of The Seven normally hold, to construct a mechanized god.
The Traveler then suggests heading to theFavonius Cathedralto get some information. Dainsleif agrees, but reminds the Traveler not to speak of the missing statue, and he waits outside. Inside, the Traveler finds Barbara, who tells them that they did indeed have one of their statues missing. She also tells them about the "Tyrant's Final Fury", a strange phenomenon in that people who approached Old Mondstadt were attacked by missiles for about a year before they stopped.
Rosariathen comes in and informs the pair that the Abyss Order is attackingWolvendom. The Traveler informs Dainsleif of this and they make their way there, where he insists they find Boreas and ask for more information. Arriving at the site where they first met Boreas, they find the Herald once more subjecting him to a corrupting ritual. The Traveler interrupts the ritual and the Herald flees once more.
Boreas and Razor thank them for the timely rescue. The Traveler then asks Boreas about the Field Tiller. Boreas is not interested in the name, but does tell them that a strange machine entered his territory long ago. Taking the intruder as a challenge, he fought and damaged the machine, which fled the area soon after.
The Traveler and Paimon return to Dainsleif and inform them of Boreas' account. With his and Barbara's information, they conclude that the Field Tiller is the machine tied to the Tyrant's Final Fury. Paimon then realizes that it must be theWeird StatueinStormterror's Lair.
Arriving at the domed building, they find the Field Tiller and Dainsleif concludes that it is the one the Abyss Order is seeking. Using his own methods, he extracts its eye out and takes custody of it. To ensure that the Abyss Order cannot restart their plan, he also suggests to destroy the Defiled Statue.
Returning to the ruins once more, Dainsleif senses the Herald, who attacks them with some mages. As the Herald clashes with the Traveler, it realizes that they are too strong and tries to flee in another portal, but is stopped by Dainsleif, who uses magic to put it into a chokehold. However, he is stopped by a shockwave from someone's sword.
When the smoke clears out, the Traveler is shocked because the person who interrupted the attack is none other than theirsibling. The sibling asks the Traveler why they are with Dainsleif; surprisingly enough, Dainsleif also knows them. The sibling reveals that Dainsleif is the Twilight Sword, one of the royal guards from Khaenri'ah, and he had failed to protect it, being laid upon a curse of immortality and forced to watch his people turn into monsters.
Although the Traveler insists that the sibling go home with them together, the sibling refuses because they have to fulfill the goal of the Abyss Order, or their war with destiny will not end. They tell them that they will see the truth about the world in their travels, which they had already done. As the Herald conjures a portal, the sibling leaves alongside them. Dainsleif dashes into the portal, with the Traveler trying to follow suit, but it closes on them before they could enter, leaving them depressed.
As they try to not be depressed about the events, Paimon cheers them back up, telling them that they have some useful information and that they need to keep in mind about Dainsleif as they prepare to go forInazuma. They recount the events happened so far, and Paimon tells the Traveler to prove their sibling what they're made of and the resolve to travel around Teyvat to discover the truth.

Black Stone Under a White StoneQuest TypeChapterArchonVActIIPreviousNextFlowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched SojournBeyond the Smoke and MirrorsRequirementsAdventure RankRequired40Black Stone Under a White Stoneis the second act inChapter Vof theArchon Quests.
After spending a short time with thePeople of the Springs,Paimonremarks on their hospitality and how the two days felt like a vacation to them. Just then,Mualaniand thenToninaarrives, and tells them that the group from the Night Warden Wars had returned. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the inexperiencedKachinahad fallen in battle but because the group was victorious, the Ode of Resurrection would bring her back to life. However, she should keep her head held high, as it was an honor. Mualani then explains to the Traveler that theAbysswas not as simple as it was believed to be; during thecataclysm, when the nations ofTeyvatwere attacked by it, the Abyss appeared to have specifically crafted each disaster for every tribe. Due to the actions of the then-Pyro Archonand the people, they were slowly able to repel the Abyss, but took massive casualties in the process and the damage dealt was reversed extremely slow.
Returning to the city, they meet up withKinich, who had just finished acommissionthat took longer than anticipated. Heading to the stadium, the crowd sings the Ode of Resurrection as ArchonMavuikaenters theSacred Flameto retrieve Kachina, but then exits it alone, announcing that she could not find Kachina or herAncient Name, shocking the crowd.TepexpanandTamuin, also present in the crowd, begin to heckle over Kachina's failure, despiteChasca's insistence that they successfully completed their mission and enraging Mualani. Mavuika puts a stop to their heckling, proclaiming that she herself is not even sure as to why Kachina had failed to return, and thus decides to suspend the pilgrimage until further notice. She states that doubt should be a motivation to seek truth, not a weapon to use against others, and challenges the stammering Tepexpan and Tamuin to ask her directly about their doubts about Kachina's heroism. When the pair's bravado crumbles in embarrassment and declines to ask, Mavuika points out that she hadn't stated anything to change their minds and exposes that their motivation was not to find the truth after all. Mualani asks Mavuika about the investigation, but as the Archon knows nothing further at the moment, she invites Mualani to join the investigation and meet with her in theSpeaker's Chamber. Mavuika also asks the Traveler to come along so she can speak with them as well.
In the chamber, Mavuika theorizes that the Abyss may have found a way to undermine the "rules" of the pilgrimage, threatening the Sacred Flame. Combined with the attack on the Meztli tribe, she either had to continue the pilgrimage with further casualties, or stop it at the cost of the Abyss increasing their attacks on the nation. Kinich states that the first option was less dangerous, but Mavuika believes that both options were just as bad, as it was an attempt to undermine faith in the pilgrimage, which would divide the tribes. Mavuika then states that with the help from theMasters of the Night-Wind, she could find Kachina'sAncient Nameand pinpoint her location, though a group would be needed to physically enter the Night Kingdom and find her directly. Mualani and the Traveler volunteer to rescue Kachina, as they still have many promises to uphold. Chasca also volunteers, to atone for what she considers her failure to protect Kachina during the mission.
Iansan further speculates that Mavuika had further reasons to suspend the pilgrimage, which she confirms; despite hosting the pilgrimage frequently, the production of Contending Fire was far from sufficient and that they were now at their breaking point. The suspension would also serve to keep each tribe strong to defend against the Abyss. To keep the Sacred Flame going, Mavuika decides to sacrifice her power to do so, while Kinich believes they should focus on finding the other Ancient Name bearers. Mavuika tells him that they should let time pass, as theWayobhad chosen them and it was up to them to determine how the story would end.
Suddenly, a person enters the stadium to warn the Archon that theFatuiwere present. TwoFatui Skirmishersarrive, before another person does, revealed to beCapitanoâ€” the first of theEleven Fatui Harbingers. Capitano accuses Mavuika of failing to fulfill the oath made 500 years ago and proclaims that he will usher in a new era and rules for Natlan, but first by eliminating the old. Mavuika and Capitano clash, the former managing to land a searing wound on his chest before someone from the Masters of the Night-Wind emits a fog that allows Capitano to escape. Mavuika managed to sense the presence and orders Kinich to askCitlaliwho the person could be, while back in the chamber, Paimon wonders what had happened.
In order to physically enter the Night Kingdom, aSpiritspeaker Stoneis required for the process. The group heads to theHuitztlantribe and Chasca asksWaynafor the stone. Wayna is surprised to hear why they need it and complies upon hearing their reason. He further refers them toVichama, who is experienced enough to navigate the Night Kingdom. They approach Vichama, who agrees to help as long as they help him find his friendMallkoafterwards and asks them to fetch him some materials to begin the process; some rope and obsidian. The group acquire both items at the market and learn why Vichama was depressed; during one pilgrimage, he had injured himself on the eve of battle when the Abyss attacked his tribe. Fearing that he would be a burden to the group with his injury, he and his group spoke to the Pyro Archon for an exception. While the request was granted, unfortunately, the group was beset by a larger than anticipated horde of Abyssal monsters and overwhelmed. Vichama felt that his skills would have helped to avoid the situation had he been present.
Vichama begins the ritual and is attacked by monsters, which the group manages to repel. He manages to acquire Kachina's name, but while the Traveler siphons away and purifies massive amounts of Abyssal energy from Vichama so he can push further in, he fails to find Mallko's despite being in excruciating pain. When the group discovers that they can't break the link between the Spiritspeaker Stone and Vichama to end the ritual, this forces Chasca to destroy the stone with her bow to protect everyone, and the Traveler manages to find Mallko's final memory. While Vichama is glad to have heard his voice again, he knew that the smile and tone was forced and laments his decision to stay behind. Chasca informs him that he was now contaminated with Abyssal energy though his exposure was made brief thanks to the Traveler, but advises him that he'll be fine as long as he controls his symptoms. They return to Wayna, finding Chasca's younger sister,Chuychu. Wayna explains Chasca's past of being adopted by Chuychu's family to the group, while the sisters argue off to the side over Chasca's decision to venture into the Night Kingdom. Ultimately, Chuychu agrees to support her older sister, while they inform Wayna that the stone had broken. He fears that Citlali would be angered, though he agrees to explain what happened to her later and prays for their success.
With Kachina's Ancient Name recovered, the group returns to theStadium of the Sacred Flame, where they learn that Mavuika had clashed with Capitano and her sacrifice. She leads them to another chamber where they discover a large amount of mementos the Pyro Archons had kept over the years, of which some are more familiar than others. Mavuika then explains that during the cataclysm, afterTenochhad united the tribes and saved Natlan, the first Pyro Archon laid a foundation of rules that were followed in the current day before Paimon notices a family portrait of Mavuika and her family. Just as they finish talking about it, the powder settles and the group initiates the ritual.
Kachina appears before the group, initially believing them to be an Abyss trick until she's reassured that they aren't. She informs them that during her "death", she was attacked by some Abyssal entity trying to kill her, butWayobhelped her to flee and hide. She had investigated the Night Kingdom and discovered that the Abyss was affecting the Wayob, and surmised that this was thus preventing her from coming back. She is scared of what will happen and initially tells them to leave her to not risk others, but Mualani refuses and encourages her to hang on until they can find her before losing contact. Mavuika then directs them to an entrance to the Night Kingdom and Iansan volunteers to go with them to increase the chances of success.
When they arrive at the ruins, Paimon remarks on how advanced Natlan civilization was back then, before Chasca and Iansan correct her by stating that it was actually the civilization of theelemental sovereigns. Due to the presence of the Abyss, various devices in the formerly-abandoned ruins were now activating and they fight their way through varioushilichurlsand Saurian manifestations before arriving at the rift leading to the Night Kingdom.
Stepping into the rift, the group is sent tumbling down a seemingly long drop but are unscathed. Now in the Abyss-corrupted Night Kingdom, Chasca warns the group to be on guard as many strange black entities float in the distance. An unknown entity informs them that they're manifestations of Abyssal power before introducing itself as Mallko, who they recognize as Vichama's friend. Mallko explains that after his death, he was lost to the realm until he felt a strange power calling to him, but even now he can feel his concentrated form slowly dissipating. Learning that they were here for Kachina, he offers to help them while he still can and protects them from the manifestations. They find Kachina being attacked by severalriftwolvesand kill them. Kachina is relieved to see her friends again and asks them to accompany her to the Wayob. The group agrees as Mallko explains how the Wayob's consciousness works in the Night Kingdom, and they might be able to draw out the monster responsible for the problem.
Arriving at the totem, the group begins to purify it when anAbyss Lectorcalled Comonqui arrives, having eliminated Mallko's spirit. Comonqui is a spectator who wishes to see the opportunity of destruction caused by the Abyss' power and claims that the Pyro Archon refuses to share the "primordial" power with the people and that the concepts she promotes are meaningless. Kachina is initially distraught by its words, but Mualani perks her back up and the two drive away the Lector after a brief battle. Due to Mualani's actions, a spectral entity calledTupacappears and congratulates her for acknowledging her true self and embodying the aspects of the tribe's Wayob. On making contact with Tupac, Mualani is flooded with memories of the past and realizes that the plan to save Natlan had begun during the cataclysm.
The totem is likewise purified and the Wayob speaks with Kachina, pleased with her growth before telling her to leave as an earthquake shakes the area. The group race to escape through the beam of light shining through the closing rift, but are a moment too late to reach it. Just as everything seems hopeless, Mavuika appears and shatters the ceiling of the Night Realm, allowing them to return to reality. The others are initially confused as to how she managed to do it (being a projection of her consciousness) and they decide to ask her herself, though it appears that Iansan had a good idea of what happened and is quietly upset.
Returning to the Speaker's Chamber, Chuychu treats the Natlanese for Abyssal contamination and is fascinated by the Traveler's apparent Abyss immunity, while Paimon is surprised to note that she herself is also completely fine. Mavuika states that they will play an important part in saving Natlan and explains that after the cataclysm, the tribes and their Wayob were weakened and needed to be strengthened again. When the Wayob picked their name bearer, it would be an indication that the tribe was back at fighting strength. By the time the Traveler had arrived, three of the tribes had prepared their heroes; Kinich, Iansan andXilonen, though they now have a fourth with Mualani. However, parts of the plan failed to reach some of the tribes, and they only have less than a year to find the remaining two people before the nation would be destroyed. She advises patience to find the other two heroes, as pressuring them beforehand could be detrimental to the plan. Mavuika reveals that the keepsakes she had shown them before had traces of Contending Flame in them from their previous owners, which she had sacrificed by burning the entire lot to give herself the emergency boost needed to save them from the Night Kingdom. Having hoped that the Archon wouldn't have to resort to that Iansan feels regret at the loss, but Mavuika states that the items' owners had given them to the Pyro Archons in hopes that they could contribute to Natlan's survival. Had they known the collection would save heroes like themselves in the future, they wouldn't have mourned their destruction. Nonetheless, with Kachina safely returned, the group heads to the inn to celebrate.
At theWeary Inn, Pacal and the others celebrate Kachina's return. During the festivities, Mavuika speaks with the Traveler, and asks them to assist in saving Natlan. Mavuika promises to lend them her support and even forge them an Ancient Name of their own if they accept, which, while stating that such a motivation was not necessary, they naturally oblige with. With their agreement, she prepares to place an order with Xilonen to make one for them. As she is highly skilled, Mavuika is confident Xilonen can find a way to forge an Ancient Name for a non-Natlanese.
In the wilds of Natlan,Rezanovinforms Capitano that the Pyro Archon had lost much of her power and asks if they should take theGnosis. Capitano refuses, having acknowledged and respected her win against him and thus refuses to resort to dishonorable means. An unknown person then tells him that Mavuika had decided not to dispel the fog they had created to escape and asks what his next plan of action is. Capitano acknowledges their usefulness before asking them if they had heard something from "here."

Beyond the Smoke and MirrorsQuest TypeChapterArchonVActIIIPreviousNextBlack Stone Under a White StoneThe Rainbow Destined to BurnRequirementsAdventure RankRequired40Beyond the Smoke and Mirrorsis the third act inChapter Vof theArchon Quests.
Two days later at Natlan'sAdventurers' Guildbranch,Piltzinshares intelligence about theAbyss' movements withKatheryne. As he leaves, theTravelerandPaimonwalk up and ask if there's anything to do. She tells them that due to the rapid threat of the Abyss, thePyro Archondecided to have theScions of the Canopyand the guild work together to disseminate information and tackle threats more efficiently. To that end, the Archon is gathering forces to have them stationed across the nation. Katheryne reminds them to take a rest just asKachinacomes across them, feeling well enough to travel to the stadium and sign up to be one of the stationed warriors.Xilonenhad told her that she was making the Traveler anAncient Nameand was all ready to begin, having set aside her regular commissions to focus on the job.
Heading to the"Children of Echoes", Kachina leads the Traveler and Paimon to Xilonen's workshop. Xilonen is taken by surprise to see that the person she was forging an Ancient Name for was an outlander, asMavuikahad neglected to tell her about it, only that the person was a traveler and that it would be "quite difficult". Noting that if Mavuika had told her she would have only argued with her about it, she explains that making an Ancient Name for an outlander is impossible, even if they had done many great deeds. Kachina tells Xilonen that she saw plenty of them in their handbook, but Xilonen clarifies that the deeds had to be done in Natlan so theNight Kingdomcould record them, but even if they had, the Night Kingdom doesn't record deeds done by someone that isn't Natlanese. Despite the seemingly impossible task, Xilonen chooses to view it as proof of Mavuika's confidence in her and intends to complete it as a test of her abilities. First, they would need to be acknowledged by theWayob; Paimon suggests talking to theChildren of Echoes' Wayobthey metbefore, though Xilonen points out that it might not be the best contender, so the Traveler wonders if they would need to have all six Wayob acknowledge them.
Xilonen is unsure if that would be the way forward, so she decides they should consult withCitlali, an expert on all things Night Kingdom and Wayob, though she points out that she's often busy, holed up in her room and obtaining an audience with her was hard. Paimon then awkwardly explains it could be harder, as they had broken herSpiritspeaker Stonein the process of rescuing Kachina. Xilonen states that they should point to her that it was a task ordered by the Archon, believing that she would not defy her. Xilonen also decides to write a letter in support of the Traveler, which Kachina suggests havingKinichdeliver, a seasoned negotiator with whom Citlali is familiar.
Kinich meets up with the group at the nearbyStatue of The Seven, where he accepts the letter and plans to apologize to Citlali for what happened with the Spiritspeaker Stone. Xilonen learns that the Traveler and Kachina are aware of the plan, while Kinich informs them that the person who rescuedCapitanowasOroron, a member of theMasters of the Night-Wind, though he spends most of his time living alone. When Citlali had realized he was missing, Ororon was gone for quite a while, though Paimon wonders as to how she was the first to know he was missing if she spent most of her time cooped up in her room. Kinich is not sure if Ororon voluntarily or involuntarily joined theFatui, and thus assumes that Citlali would be eager to clear his name to the rest of the tribe. Having to wait for Citlali's response and Kachina needing to pack ahead of her deployment assignment, the group parted ways.
Two days later, the Traveler and Paimon return to Xilonen's workshop, who tells them that she did not respond to the letter. However, she might be at theStadium of the Sacred Flame, though she is not there either. This prompts Paimon to complain about her age just as she actually arrives and scares her. Xilonen apologizes to the Traveler and Paimon for not telling them that Citlali looks much younger than her title suggested, though Citlali herself was also unsure as to how to approach them without making it awkward as she was the last to arrive. Xilonen then tells Citlali of what Mavuika had tasked her to do. Citlali agrees to help them with the Ancient Name if they can help prove Ororon's innocence. Citlali holds the Traveler's hand to examine their past, remarking that they have a plethora of experiences beyond that which most mortals could only dream of, before sensing something on them. She dispels the presence, telling them that it was the residue of several souls clinging to their body when they visited the Night Kingdom.
Citlali agrees to follow Xilonen's proposal, though the decision ultimately lies with the Lord of the Night, as the matter is far outside the Wayobs' jurisdiction. She explains that the Lord of the Night is an entity in the Night Kingdom that uses the power of the Sacred Flame to repel the Abyss. As the Lord of the Night is currently in slumber, the only way they can communicate with it was to enter its "dream" by going into a trance. Xilonen offers to get the needed materials to perform the rite, while the Traveler and Paimon would help track down Ororon. Citlali reveals that she had arrived late as she spent some time investigating Ororon's home, noting that his Phlogiston Aphids were off and there were marks made by Snezhnayan weapons. She is not sure as to why the Fatui would be interested in a young man in his twenties, though does not leave out the possibility that he had accidentally caught their attention. She decides they'll start investigating based on his last known location.
Arriving at Ororon's last known location after sunset, Citlali states that an eyewitness had seen Ororon speak to several Fatui. She still finds it hard to believe that he would willingly side with the Fatui, prompting Paimon to ask about him. Citlali states that Ororon was an orphan who was raised by the tribe. The aphids were leaving behind a trail of phlogiston, though the Traveler and Paimon are unable to see it until Citlali assists them. As they follow the trail, they hear Citlali's thoughts of insecurity, a side effect of her spell. They soon find an abandoned campsite, where Citlali notices a symbol which was known to the tribe as a distress signal.
Further up the trail, Citlali realizes a fight had taken place and the trail went into separate paths. She takes one, while the Traveler and Paimon take the other. As they follow the trail, it suddenly ends. The Traveler wonders what was going on just as a voice tells them that they were adept at sensing the wind beneath the earth, falling unconscious and into the Night Kingdom. A man sneaks up from behind and orders the Traveler not to move, as they have nowhere to escape in the Night Kingdom, a domain the Masters of Night-Wind have mastery over. The man introduces himself as Ororon, who tells them the paths were set up by his friend to quickly set up a meeting.
Capitano greets the Traveler, who had heard about them from his colleagues and had expressed a desire to meet them in person. He explains to the Traveler about his goals, motivations and mistrust of Mavuika, believing it was not worth blindly following her plan. He tells them if they wished to know more, they should meet him east of the Stadium, but warns them not to tell anyone else as he did not want a conflict. Ororon asks the Traveler not to tell Citlali of the meeting, as he was trying to avoid having her get involved. The Traveler's soul returns to reality, where Paimon had been worried for them. Citlali then arrives, though the Traveler decides not to inform either of their meeting. Citlali managed to find a Fatui camp and believes Ororon might be held there.
They confirm that Ororon is in the camp as a Fatuus namedKosterlitzkyorders Ororon to get back to work. Citlali explodes with anger and they beat up all the Fatui, before scolding Ororon for forgetting the warnings that he had been taught. She then asks why he had saved Capitano, and he tells her that if he hadn't, they would have gone for her instead. Nonetheless, with Ororon safely recovered, they return to the Speaker's Chamber and give a report toCoyopa, who tells Ororon to return once the Archon had made her decision. As Citlali brings Ororon away to look for lodging, the Traveler discloses their meeting with him and Capitano when they collapsed. Paimon is surprised to learn of the revelation, but agrees to help them regardless.
The following night, the Traveler and Paimon head to the meeting spot. Ororon appears first, and upon confirming the coast is clear, calls Capitano over. Capitano believes he was right with his judgement, stating that despite their intentions, he had learned fromChildethat they were passionate about the unknown and willing to take risks; as such, he did not want them to be an enemy, but rather an ally. If they were to continue on the current path, they would end up fighting him, and he believes that once he told them the truth, they might consider his proposal instead. Capitano does not believe Mavuika's plan would be successful, as he is not sure if the two heroes would appear, and even if they did â€” their power might not be enough, and all of Teyvat would suffer for her mistake. He reveals that there was another plan that she did not tell them, though executing it would cost dearly. Believing she is plagued with doubt, she would ignore the harsh reality until it was too late for the plan to actually work.
Paimon is not convinced by his logic, believing that he was there to grab theGnosisfor theTsaritsa. The Traveler realizes that the backup plan involves the Gnosis, and Capitano states that his plan could be implemented if they reach an agreement. However, he cuts himself off and inexplicably disappears, while Ororon senses something coming â€” a furious Citlali, who had suspected something was off when they had been separated. Citlali is angered that Ororon was colluding with the Fatui and demands an explanation, though he is not able to explain it. Before she could discipline him, Paimon intervenes.
The Traveler is upset that Citlali had interrupted a crucial moment in the meeting, but believes that Ororon might know something. As they walk back to the stadium, Ororon tricks the group by grinding a powder that causes an illusion, claiming that what he was doing was in Natlan's best interests. Citlali becomes even more furious, but the Traveler manages to calm her down and asks about his "duty." Citlali suggests they talk over a meal, and they head to theWeary Inn. Citlali consumes large amounts of alcohol and ends up getting drunk, while ordering another drink from the owner.Chancais surprised to see that Citlali had made friends with the outlanders. Citlali becomes even more drunk and soon falls asleep, seemingly becoming sound before she jolts herself back up, scaring Paimon. The Traveler and Paimon disclose to her that when she used her spell on them, they could hear her thoughts, leaving her completely embarrassed.
Citlali asks them to follow her to a secluded spot in the stadium for a casual conversation, where she expresses her insecurity about her tribe calling her old. She also reveals that Ororon is a unique outlier in the tribe, as he has an incomplete soul, something which is taken as a bad omen by the tribe. As such, they tried to use him as a vessel to hold souls from the Night Kingdom and asked her for approval. She disapproved, though they still went with it regardless â€” the ritual failed and Ororon escaped with his life, though he was upset that he was not able to contribute. As Citlali leaves, the Traveler decides to ask Mavuika about the backup plan.
Returning to the inn to rest, the Traveler and Paimon are woken up by a commotion outside the inn. They find Citlali outside, who reveals that the Abyss had launched a nation-wide attack, including her own tribe and thus has to go back to oversee efforts. As they head outside, they findMualani,Chasca,ChuychuandIansan. Iansan informs them that the Abyss attacked the Masters of Night-Wind, Children of Echoes, Collective of Plenty and numerous outposts all at once. Chasca and Chuychu were trying to look for survivors in the wilds, while Iansan would return to her tribe and Mualani would head to the Children of Echoes. The Traveler informs them that they need to speak to Mavuika. She learns from them they met the Captain and asks if the backup plan was true, which she confirms; but doing so would erase everything from the Night Kingdom, including their history and culture. Even then, there was a risk of corrosion if the Ley Lines were not repaired, thus making the attempt futile as it would eventually happen all over again. She asks them to keep the matter a secret, though she wonders how he was aware of the plan.
Mavuika states that she cares for the people and wants them to win in the safest way possible, thus her current plan was the best choice for the moment. She also reveals that she would participate in the defense, as while she isn't as strong as agodwould be, she was already an experienced warrior before she ascended. She tells them that they would need to track the Captain to learn of his plan for Natlan before bidding them farewell as they head to the Children of Echoes to assist Mualani. With the people heading to safety, all that was left is a caravan ambushed by the monsters. They rescue the caravan, and the Traveler informs them of Capitano's intel. They agree that his plan was not in Natlan's best interests; the Traveler and Paimon return to the Speaker's Chamber to see what the intelligence officers had acquired.
The two find Chasca and Chuychu, who reveal that the Fatui were defending people from the attacks. While they did not sense an ulterior motive, they overhear the Captain being mentioned and decide to trail them back to their camp to gather intelligence. Chasca initially tries to enter alone, but Chuychu forces her to take her along. Cooperating with each other, they sneak past the Fatui and cause a distraction by throwing a stink bomb near someCapybaras, causing the Fatui and a local tribe to begin arguing. Chasca manages to discover that the Fatui were looking for the "Source Mechanism," though is unsure as to why they were interested in it. As two Fatuus decide to bring the item back to the Captain, Chuychu decides to continue following them, though one of the Fatuus overhears them and gives chase. They managed to chase them off and found more mechanisms, but believing they were waiting to trap them, decided to return to the Stadium.
Mavuika thanks the two for their efforts and decides to have all the scholars familiar with the Secret Source gathered to see what the Captain's plan would be. They head to the stadium's north entrance and bid the two farewell. After they leave, they try to compile all of the information, but believe that they're one step away from the answer. Citlali then arrives, revealing that Ororon had returned to defend the tribe. While he kept his distance from her, Citlali reveals that his soul periodically needed to be stabilized and thus hadIfadeliver a replacement gem for him. The bag also contained a spell that copied all of his memories into the old gem, so they would be able to see what he was hiding. Citlali intends to go alone, but the Traveler convinces her to take them and Paimon along.
As Ororon tends to his garden, he is first approached by a local tribesman who tells him about the Fatui. Later that night, Capitano visits him, asking him why he lived alone before asking if he knew Citlali. He senses his lie and takes his leave, prompting Ororon to chase after him to see what the Fatui were planning. He tracks them down to a camp, though a subordinate accompanying him,Tarko, spots him. Capitano states that he isn't a threat before Tarko becomes dizzy. Sensing that souls from the Night Kingdom had escaped, Capitano uses a spell to dispel the souls, surprising Ororon. Capitano tells Tarko to remain alert for further disturbances, though their primary objective is collecting information.
A few days later, Capitano heads to the stadium to confront Mavuika, ordering two subordinates with him and the others to stay behind and retreat if the plan fails. As he is injured by Mavuika, Ororon senses a familiar soul trying to escape; realizing that the lead would be lost if Capitano dies, he decides to intervene and save him. Capitano reveals to Ororon that he was looking into the Night Kingdom, though he tries to keep him out of the plan until Ororon reveals that he also could sense the truth.
In another camp, Capitano believes that rather than placing a net to stop the damage, the only way to save Natlan would be to reconstruct its Ley Lines.
With the memory over, Citlali is angered that Ororon can't let go of the past, though they quickly focus on the task at hand. With Capitano intending to rebuild the Ley Lines in a manner similar to the Loom of Fate, manipulating them would result in everyone's memories being affected. Seeing how serious he was with the plan, they decide to inform Mavuika immediately.

Heading to the Speaker's Chamber, Mavuika informs the three that she had located Capitano. Citlali informs her of Ororon's memory, of which she finds it dangerous and that his plan needed to be stopped, as it would be the same as using the Gnosis. Paimon wonders as to what forces they have, as the Abyss is still attacking. Mavuika states that she, Xilonen, Kinich and the Traveler would fight the Fatui, having a plan to handle the threat.
Mavuika intends to fight the Captain again, stating that if they could destroy the Source Mechanism, his plan would be stopped. Kinich and Xilonen advise against fighting him again, since she had lost her powers to fuel the Sacred Flame. Mavuika tells Kinich that Capitano would be guarding the device, and thus he and Ajaw would distract the bulk of the Fatui with a frontal assault while Xilonen would bring the others close to the device to destroy it. They ambush a patrol away from the camp and excavate a tunnel, infiltrating the base.
The group manages to reach Capitano and Ororon, who activates the device. Suddenly, Ororon becomes inexplicably powerful and attempts to attack Xilonen, only for Capitano to stop him and use a spell on him, demanding to know the entity occupying his body. The entity address him as "Commander," though the distraction allows the Traveler to shut the device off. The entity is upset that Capitano still worries for others even if it means losing.
Elsewhere, Ororon looks at his previous memories before a strange soul namedGuthred, aKhaenri'ahnwho insults Ororon over his worthlessness and plans to take his body once he dies. Ororon, refusing to go down quietly as he hadn't done anything meaningful in his life, resolves to keep going as a bright light appears from above. Mavuika commends Ororon for being able to withstand the pain with a damaged soul before asking if it was truly what he wanted. Ororon states that he just wants an answer for his life, just as hisAncient Name"Bidii," or devotion, appears for him revealingSanhaj, a hero of the Masters of Night-Wind from the past. He is the fifth hero in the plan to repel the Abyss for good.
A voice then echoes through the cavern, revealing itself to beYohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night, that Citlali had mentioned earlier. When the device was activated, it resulted in a cry that affected Ororon more due to his damaged soul, though she was impressed by how he managed to compose himself. Xilonen asks if that was responsible for his odd behavior, but the Lord of the Night tells her that another soul had tried to take refuge but was expelled, though its origins were unknown. Capitano asks why the Source Mechanism only awoke her rather than repair the lines, and she tells him that it was the source of the nation's Ley Lines. Mavuika explains that when the Descender and the dragons fought, it caused immense damage, especially to Natlan's Ley Lines. To stabilize them, the Lord of the Night used fragments of the old Ley Lines to reconstruct a similar network â€” the Night Kingdom.
The dragons tried to use the device to strengthen the Ley Lines with power, though they were ineffective as they could not navigate their intricate structures. As the Ley Lines have changed again, the Lord of the Night could rebuild the Ley Lines once more at the cost of her existence, while revealing that in the past, she was worshipped as a "lord" â€” before her kind died out, they were known as "Angels," though they are more commonly known in their devolved form asSeelies. The Lord of the Night states that due to Capitano and Ororon's plan, she could fulfill her promise to rebuild the Ley Lines at Mavuika's command, though Mavuika refuses; it would be no different than using the Gnosis. Capitano states that they don't have a choice, but Mavuika states that if the Abyss were to invade again, it would be worse for future generations. Paimon asks why he was so pessimistic about the situation, and he reveals that he is a survivor of Khaenri'ah who personally witnessed the horrors of the Abyss.
Capitano insists on ignoring false hope and maximizing the chances of survival, while Mavuika continues to reject his reasoning as it would make their life meaningless. As the two continue arguing, Ororon interjects, stating that with his life rekindled, he wishes to have a life with meaning. Xilonen agrees with him, and the Lord of the Night states that she is ready to perform the deed if they need to in the foreseeable future. Capitano begrudgingly agrees to Mavuika's plan, as it had the potential to create the best outcome and grants her his subordinates to use along with his direct assistance. With a new plan in tow, they leave to have the group outside stop fighting each other.
Returning to the Speaker's Chamber, Mavuika formally welcomes the Fatui into the alliance against the Abyss. She then asks Capitano how he knew about the Source Mechanism â€” he reveals that since they weren't getting to the Gnosis, he decided to look for alternate means with Ororon's help. They had tracked down three scholars;Aberewaa,BosomtweandCuxtal, combining their research to locate it. Paimon then asks him how he knew about the Gnosis' power, and he reveals that after the situation in Khaenri'ah had become unsalvageable, he fled with the rest of his platoon to Natlan, which was suffering the same fate. He met with the Masters' chief,Ayizu, who treated him with respect even though many people blamed Khaenri'ah for the disaster. Thus, he resolved to protect Natlan and fought many battles with him, though when he died, he revealed the secret of the Gnosis to him. Mavuika is surprised that he had told Capitano of it, though she had refused all of his suggestions to use it even before the cataclysm. However, she fails to recognize Capitano and assumes the mask must be why.
Capitano states that despite his curse, his flesh still rotted and thus he would not be recognizable to her. Paimon then asks if he knew aboutDainsleif, as he didn't appear to be having as much of an issue. Capitano is surprised to learn they know of him, so Paimon asks if he knew him too. He states that he only knew his name and that he was travelling with theTraveler's Siblingthe last time he saw him in person, noting that his pain and hatred was much stronger than his own. Thus, as the Traveler was the sibling of Dainsleif's companion, he did not want to harm them. He also laments that apart from his physical appearance, his strength had also waned, though Mavuika states that he was still incredibly strong. Capitano states that if they had fought 500 years ago, the outcome could have been much more different. Regardless, he acknowledges that he failed to acquire the Gnosis, as he intended to use it to save Natlan and then, should it have not been destroyed in the attempt, give it to the Tsaritsa.
Mavuika tells him that her opinion on the matter would not change, so Paimon asks what would happen when all six heroes were united. She tells them that they would use a power thatXbalanquegained fromRonova, a god who predated the Archons and had power over death. Mavuika states that the Abyss would likely increase their attacks after sensing the change in Ororon.
The Traveler and Paimon leave the chamber to find Kachina and Mualani tending to various people. The Traveler notes that a sense of dread appears to be intensifying and wonders if they have enough time for the final hero to appear.
Returning to the Weary Inn once more for a short rest, Citlali and Xilonen meet up to visit the Lord of the Night. The Lord of the Night asks if they intend to give the Traveler an Ancient Name even though it would mean Xilonen would have to sacrifice her life for doing so, confirming to Citlali that what she heard about the forging of an Ancient Name consuming the life of the Name Engraver was indeed true. Meanwhile, Citlali intends to use the Traveler's status as a Descender to stall Mavuika's death, as it was what she foresaw in her ritual, though the Lord of the Night cautions that the fate of someone's death and death itself are actually two different things, and all the Traveler can affect is if Mavuika dies in the near future or not. the Lord of the Night tells them that she could not give them much advice on the matter, but is impressed by human determination and knew that their creator had looked on them favorably. Citlali also voices a desire to find a way to keep the Lord of the Night alive after Natlan has dealt with the Abyss, a sentiment that the Lord is grateful for but states that there's nothing they can do. In her view of the grand scheme of things, how much longer she lives is a non-issue, though the pair point out that is what makes humans different, and even if their end comes tomorrow, humanity will still do whatever it takes to survive today. The Lord of the Night creates thePilgrim's Chronicle, a parchment that would record the Traveler's deeds in Natlan, both past and future.
Back at the inn, the Traveler and Paimon wake up from their rest and meet up with Citlali and Xilonen, who hand them the parchment. On examining it, Paimon spots that it has recorded that they previously helped Kachina win thePilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame. The Traveler is somewhat concerned that the item came at a high price, but Citlali and Xilonen deflect the question by pointing out that the Lord of the Night was willing to sacrifice herself for Natlan and in comparison, the parchment cost nothing. Just then, Kachina runs in, telling them that the Abyss was attacking once again.
Heading outside the stadium, Mavuika ordersTumpisto inform the others about her battle plan against the Abyss, just as the group arrives and gets a rundown from her. The Abyss had sensed Ororon's acknowledgement and were increasing their attacks all over the nation, as even remote areas in the Collective of Plenty were reporting attacks. As such, they only needed to hold out for the last hero, so Mavuika sends Xilonen and Kachina to their tribe while Citlali would use a hot air balloon to return to her tribe. Mavuika tasks the Traveler and Paimon with handling various matters across the nation, granting them a hot air balloon for faster travelling.
After handling several matters, the Traveler returns to a checkpoint outside the stadium, repelling a massive Abyss attack. As the battle rages, a massive surge of energy envelops the Sacred Flame, causing numerous pylons to appear and drop off both normal and abyssal manifestations of hilichurls and riftwolves. Mavuika manages to subdue the rift briefly with the Gnosis, while the Natlanese and the Fatui fight the monsters. Kinich also heads out to investigate the rift.
Despite the efforts of the defenders, the Abyssal invasion slowly begins to overwhelm them. The Traveler and Paimon witness the horrors of war as they see the bodies of both humans and Saurians littering the battlefield, having sacrificed their lives to protect others. At a camp in theSulfurous Veins, the Traveler assists the remaining defenders in repelling an attack. Regardless if the Traveler had helped out or not,Chimallideclares the base lost and allows the group to either support the Children of Echoes or retreat to the stadium. To his surprise, all of his soldiers wish to join in the fight, as to honor the sacrifices made by their allies. Just then, the Traveler spots a purple streak crashing to the ground, which Chimalli realizes had landed near the People of the Springs. The group parts ways, with the Traveler heading to investigate the crash site.
Arriving at the site, they discover that their attacks fail to deal any damage to the tumor. Worried that more monsters might come, Paimon tells the Traveler to look for anything of value. They find a battle report, though the situation is incredibly dire with casualties increasing as more tumors begin to fall across the nation. As they take a hot air balloon, Paimon becomes horrified with the amount of monsters roaming the wilds, and they soon see that the Scions of the Canopy had fallen to them. Continuing onward, Paimon has had enough of the war, though the Traveler is confident they would eventually prevail in the end.
They soon spot a group of people fighting several riftwolves and slay the monsters, allowing a brief moment of respite. Paimon wonders as to how they can destroy the tumors, whileMaztlastates that that they have no idea. He believes they came from the "sky-demon" from above and they generated massive amounts of pylons, overwhelming the defenders. Aware that they are on a losing battle, they decide the best course of action is to retreat to the stadium, where the Sacred Flame would repel the Abyss. The Traveler and Paimon head to the Children of Echoes to help with evac, finding Kachina and Xilonen fighting the monsters off. Pacal had ordered a full evacuation, and they and a few others had stayed behind to stop the monsters from pursuing them. They eliminate the monsters before leaving the village, where they reunite with the other group that had left earlier.
Kachina informs them that Kinich returned with news that the tumors had dropped all across the nation, while the Flower-Feather Clan was hit the hardest. Kinich had organized a team to provide support, while Paimon is worried about Chasca and Chuychu. Pacal states that it would only be a matter of time before the stadium would be unfeasible to defend, resulting in a bloodbath. The Traveler resolves to help out, while Xilonen, Kachina and Pacal bring the group to the stadium.
On the way, they find Chasca and Chuychu surrounded by a few monsters and eliminate them. Paimon then notices that Chuychu is unconscious and contaminated with abyssal energy. The Traveler siphons away the energy and purifies it which allows Chuychu to wake up, but despite their efforts to save her she ultimately succumbs to her injuries, but not before thanking Chasca and saying goodbye. Chasca flies into a rage, emitting abyssal energy for a brief moment, but left with Chuychu's final words of comfort finds the strength to calm herself. The Traveler and Paimon give her some space, but Paimon spots Chasca crouching over Chuychu as her Ancient Name appears. The bearer,Menilek, remarks on the pain Chasca was suffering, thus making her the final hero for Mavuika's plan. They bring her body to the stadium, with everyone present acknowledging her sacrifice. Mavuika promises to honor her and bring the war to an end now that all six heroes are assembled.
Heading to the center of the stadium, Mavuika and the six heroes begin the ritual to empower their Archon, who declares a Night Warden War with the Ode of Resurrection now applying to everyone in Natlan. The six are resolved to stomp the Abyss for good, while Chasca thanks the Traveler for coming in time, allowing Chuychu to say her final words and allowing her to control her grief. The group then sets out to destroy the tumors, with Mavuika's powers assisting in destroying them. As the defenders begin to repel the Abyss, Kinich senses that it's now sending larger units around the stadium in an attempt to extinguish the Sacred Flame. The group rushes back to defend the stadium, and as the last of the monsters are dealt with, Mavuika uses her powers to destroy the rift, much to the joy of the Natlanese. The sheer strength of her attack briefly exposes a"false sky,"though no one appears to pay much attention to it.
With the battle over, the group assembles at the Weary Inn, where a celebratory feast is being held. Mavuika states that their efforts have forced the Abyss deep into the depths of the Night Kingdom, and she will go there alone to stamp out the remaining traces of Abyss, as the levels of Abyss energy would be instantly lethal on contact for anyone else. She promises to grant the fallen a worthy funeral, while Xilonen suggests giving a moment of silence for them. Mavuika then thanks Capitano for his efforts, who gives his congratulations on the Natlaneses' victory.
The Traveler speaks with Mavuika, who expresses regret for not being able to save Chuychu. Nonetheless, she asks if they would be willing to accompany her to the depths of the Night Kingdom, though the plan's details would be discussed tomorrow.
After resting for the night, they head to the Speaker's Chamber, during which Citlali intercepts them, telling them that despite their valiant efforts in defending the nation, Mavuika's use of Ronova's powers meant that she was still slated to die. Citlali asks them to try and circumvent her death by some means. Mavuika reminisces about her past before the Traveler arrives, and after learning of the Lord of the Night's gift, reveals her reasoning for requesting their aid: their resistance to the Abyss meant that the Traveler would be the only known person that could safely join her final assault, but only if their Ancient Name could be completed. She would go alone rather than risk the Traveler not having access to the Ode of Resurrection, but if they do become a true Ancient Name bearer, she would love to have them there to back her up. Unfortunately, this meant that Paimon would have to stay behind, as the Abyss could otherwise make her a target and put them into a dangerous situation.
Elsewhere, Capitano returns to the Lord of the Night, aware that Mavuika used Ronova's powers and thus will have to die for doing so. The Lord of the Night wonders how he was aware of it before realizing that the Ruler of Death had also sent him on a long journey. He has his own final foe to face, and asks for her help for the sake of the lost souls and Natlan's future.

In the aftermath ofAbyssal invasion, the tribes of Natlan are busy handling the short-term effects. Paimon suggests to the Traveler that they visit the Flower-Feather Clan, since they had been hit the hardest. When they arrive, they find that Iansan and a group of people from the Collective of Plenty were already at work. While her tribe was spared from the brunt of the invasion, she decided to help out at the Flower-Feather Clan since they were hurt a lot more. She asks them to follow her, leading them to the chief,Mutota, who tells them that after the battle, they found several of their people in the wilderness, but they were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder;Atoco,CochittaandOcotlan. He suspects thatGosoythothwas too powerful for them, explaining to Paimon that it was the Abyssal rift that appeared during the invasion, which was also known as the "Reaper of the Abyss."
Mutota had learned that there was a treatment hundreds of years ago, but its knowledge was lost in the present day. The Traveler offers to help and tries to purify the energy within them, but nothing happens. Iansan suggests moving them to a more comfortable environment in order to get them to loosen up while being under watchful eyes. The chief agrees with her suggestion and has the three moved away. They first visit Atoco, where he remarks on being cold. Iansan suggests building a bonfire for warmth, and through it they learn the nameDuarte. They askIzcalliabout Duarte, who reveals that Duarte was Atoco's saurian companion who died four years ago during an abyssal attack. This prompts them to take on the appearance of aQucusaurusand they return to Atoco as one. The plan appears to work before Atoco becomes suspicious, prompting the Traveler to slam him, putting him back to his senses. Upon learning the situation from them, Atoco apologizes for their efforts, while Iansan tells him that he needs to move on and accept Duarte's death.
The three then head to Cochitta and are unsure as to how to help her when Mutota arrives, having learned that Atoco's stress was handled. Upon learning of their plan, he tells her about her past â€” Cochitta also had a younger brother, and their parents died fighting the Abyss. While she resolved to become a warrior, she was still riddled with fear and doubt until the Abyss attacked one day, and she protected her brother from a monster. After that incident, she became a renowned fighter and the tribe was glad of her prowess, only for it to unravel during the invasion. Suddenly, Cochitta's brother,Cuallee, arrives with a toy weapon, demanding to know the location of the monster that hurt her. The Traveler convinces her to continue fighting, and she resolves to do so. Mutota tells them that a few monsters fled north after the battle, and while he sent a group to eliminate them, there could be a few stragglers lying about.
They discover a group of three riftwolves, and Cochitta kills them with the Traveler and Iansan's help. Doing so gives her the confidence she once had, and upon learning what had happened, apologizes to the two for the efforts they went to help her. While she and Cuallee share a moment, Iansan tells them that they can return to the tribe whenever they felt like it, having ensured that there would be no other monsters on the way back. Returning to the tribe,OhtliandItotiatalk about the Traveler's assistance. They later meet up with Iansan, before they are informed that Ocotlan is going out of control.
Ocotlan, believing the tribe is overrun (mistaking the people as Abyss monsters), attacks the group. He then tries to attack his fatherMunay, but Iansan and the Traveler subdue him. They are unsure as to how to cure him, as he doesn't even acknowledge them as people, only for Capitano to appear and tell them that he's suffering from Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome, which he deemed had "resurfaced" again. He states that while some people could be cured through verbal or physical interaction (as the case with Atoco and Cochitta), Ocotlan is entrenched deep in his hallucinations that medical intervention is the only cure, with the Draught of Lucidity being needed. He explains that it was only used for the most severe cases, as the patient would suffer from chronic migraines for the rest of their life. Munay allows the treatment, so Iansan gives him it. Ocotlan returns to his normal self, explaining that he had a vision where the tribe was overrun with monsters. Munay tells him to relax and asks Capitano for his name, grateful for his help.
As Iansan takes Ocotlan away, Capitano gives her additional medicine for any other warriors who might need it. He then reveals that after he had fled from Khaenri'ah with his platoon to Natlan, he saw their struggle against the Abyss. Despite seeing the people as inexperienced, he found their resolve commendable and saw that they shared a common enemy. Paimon asks if he was also skilled in medicine, but Capitano states that Guthred was the one who had developed it, who was a respected military doctor and his second-in-command during the cataclysm. During their fight against the Abyss, several of his men tried to kill each other, prompting Guthred to fast-track the medicine's development by using himself as a test subject; he died shortly after it was completed. Capitano remarks that their goals are not aligned, revealing that the souls of the land are not at peace, and thus his work is not done either.
Capitano allows the Traveler to ask him a question, and the Traveler remarks about Mavuika's use of Ronova's power which would mean she was slated for death. The Traveler asks about Ronova, and Capitano tells them that she was responsible for both his and his peoples' suffering. He takes off his mask and reveals his true face to them, shocking both. He states that the Ruler of Death is able to freely interpret the form of death or grant immortality to any she desires, stating that before the final moment truly came, they had to fight harder than ever. Iansan then returns, informing the Traveler that a messenger from the Scions of the Canopy were looking for them, as Xilonen was able to begin progress on creating the Traveler's Ancient Name.
Returning to the Stadium of Sacred Flame, they find that Mualani, Kinich, Ajaw, Kachina, Citlali and Ororon were waiting for them. Ajaw scolds them for taking their time, only for Kinich to fling him away and tell them that they had only arrived. To the group's surprise, Chasca soon arrives, having heard of the Traveler's assistance to her tribe and thanks them for their help. Xilonen impressed with the turnout, as there were more people than she needed. She explains to them that they would need to talk about the Traveler's feats in front of the Pilgrim's Chronicle, while the Traveler would need to leave for the duration. Paimon follows them, but to her surprise, Xilonen comes for her too, as she was still their companion despite not hailing from Natlan. Some time passes before she calls the Traveler over, stating that Paimon had plenty of information to share. She returns the chronicle to them, stating that she would need it when the time came to forge the Ancient Name, and once she had done so, the war could finally end.

Incandescent Ode of Resurrectionis the fifth act inChapter Vof theArchon Quests.
Mavuika requests the Traveler's presence; believing that their Ancient Name is ready to be forged, Paimon suggests taking a rest at the Weary Inn, wanting to be at their best when they receive it. As they fall asleep, the Traveler soon finds themselves in the Night Kingdom. Continuing on the path set to them, they wonder if the Night Kingdom would be healed once the Abyss was driven out for good. They soon find a wall of light, before finding several figures trying to get through it. Approaching the wall, they walk through it, noting that they were frozen when they did so and that the souls outside were in torment.
They soon discover Capitano and Guthred, though they do not appear to see her. Capitano tells his "soldiers" to continue pressing on, stating that he would fulfill his promise to bring them to the destined place. A noticeable rift also appears on his chest and the Traveler is brought back to reality, where Paimon asks if they were all right.
The Traveler and Paimon head to the Speaker's Chamber, where they find Mavuika alongside Xilonen and Citlali. They were discussing about the plan to enter the Night Kingdom, which Xilonen and Citlali assure that the Traveler's Ancient Name would be forged in time. Mavuika tells them that she intends to head to the deepest parts of the Night Kingdom in three days' time; if Xilonen could not forge the Ancient Name, she would have to go herself. Xilonen swears that she wouldn't fail her task and she leaves with Citlali, while Paimon is worried about leaving the Traveler, even if only for a brief moment. Mavuika suggests that they relax before the big day, despite the Traveler's insistence that they wanted to help out further. She reveals that she paints as a hobby, though her duties often prevented her from doing so.
As Mavuika heads into her room, the Traveler hears a knock on the door and tells them to enter. Kachina and Mualani arrive, telling the Traveler that they were extending an invitation to them for a huge feast before the big battle. The Traveler accepts, but then decides to have Mavuika attend it too, much to everyones' surprise. However, knowing that the Archon is also participating in the battle, they agree and extend the invitation to her, which she likewise accepts.
The group heads to the People of the Springs, where Kinich arrives with a delivery for Amina. Amina is worried about the deliveries, as the amount of supplies given were far too much for the party she had originally intended. Amina is surprised to see the Traveler, and even moreso when she spots the Archon. She reveals that the party was being set due to the Traveler's role in Natlan, and thus people were wanting to give their well-wishes for the upcoming battle. When Amina talks about how Atea would normally handle logistics, Paimon asks about her status. The group reveals that she had passed shortly after the attack on the tribe and mourned her passing. Mualani quickly perks the group back up, knowing that Atea would not want them to be upset and drags Kachina away. Mavuika then tells Amina that everyone was invited to attend, and any leftover supplies would be bought by the Speaker's Chamber to be redistributed as needed.
As the party kicks off, Iansan remarks about a dream she had about her Saurian companion, who perished during the battle against the Abyss. The others also join in on their memories, and the Traveler reveals that they dreamt of Capitano and many souls. Ororon believes that their case is a natural outlier compared to that provided by the divine throne, and reveals a ritual that could help them learn more about Capitano's future. Ororon looks into the vision and remarks about Guthred, stating that he was the one who tried to steal his body earlier. He also learned of another name, Thrain, a legendary Natlan hero, though they are not sure if Capitano is actually said hero. He also realizes that Guthred's soul had persisted for hundreds of years, something which would not normally be possible, and sensed an amalgamation of souls in Capitano's body. Mavuika suggests that he ask him directly, much to his surprise, but he agrees to do so. They return to the feast and conclude it.
The group departs on their own paths, while Kachina tells the Traveler that Xilonen is nearly finished with their Ancient Name. The Traveler accompanies her outside the Stadium, where she remarks how she brought them there and met Kinich and Mualani. Kachina thanks the Traveler for encouraging her and wishes to do the same for them. Later, they stop at an area where they first met Toto, though she remarks that he wouldn't be around the area for a while. Continuing further down the path, they encounter a Tepetlisaurus namedHanwi, who Kachina introduces as Ayo's mom. She is pacing back and forth, and when they ask her what's wrong, she darts off, prompting them to follow her. They soon find Ayo and discover that he's still despondent due to the deaths of his grandparents, not even recognizing Kachina's steak. The Traveler believes that he could be suffering from Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome and decides to administer some medicine to him, perking him back up to normal. Kachina, Hanwi andAnpaothank the Traveler.
Arriving at the Statue of the Seven, Kachina offers them an invitation for a meal if they choose to as she leaves. The Traveler and Paimon head to Xilonen's workshop, where they find Citlali. Citlali knew they had gone for the feast and tells them that despite several headaches, Xilonen was able to create the Ancient Name. Right on time, she arrives with it, revealing its name as "Tumaini," or hope. While the Ancient Name forging was simple, Xilonen points out that they need to test it to make sure it works, as it was the first time in Natlan's history that an outlander was given an Ancient Name. Xilonen brings them to a barbecue restaurant, while also pointing out that it has top-tier alcohol, gaining Citlali's interest. After dinner, Citlali reveals to the Traveler that she is worried about their and Mavuika's safety. They head to theSulfurous Veinsand conduct the test there. Citlali notes everything is fine with the Traveler's resonance while Paimon spots many souls emerging. Citlali states that it was normal, but retracts that statement as she notices more souls than usual.
Citlali has Xilonen stop the test and explains that the Traveler's soul was so powerful that it attracted everything nearby, including souls that could not enter the Night Kingdom, left it, or not even from Natlan. Not all of the souls would return to the Ley Lines and would simply be forgotten, so the group decides to save as many as they can. They approach one soul, discovering it was Vichama. Vichama thanks Citlali for using the Spiritseeker Stone and revealed how he died during the battle, though upset he was rejected by the Night Kingdom. Citlali promises to bring him there, as he deserved it as a hero. Citlali successfully sends him to the Night Kingdom, and Vichama thanks them, hoping that everyone would be safe as his final wish.
Citlali tries her best to save as many souls as possible, eventually reaching Zumalli; however, as she moves in to do so, the Abyss corrupts him, prompting Xilonen to kill him as sending him to the Night Kingdom wouldn't help, much to Citlali's disappointment. They soon discover two Teptlisaurus souls,HnaskaandCetan. Ayo suddenly appears, delighted to see his grandparents again. Citlali tries to send the souls back to the Night Kingdom, but they refuse, wanting to stay with Ayo to the very end. She reluctantly respects their decision, and the Traveler explains what they saw in their own dream. Citlali is surprised that Khaenri'ahns would be in the Night Kingdom, but decide to look into that later. Xilonen tells them to give their Ancient Name to Mavuika when they return to the Stadium, so she could explain its name and meaning to the people.
Arriving at the Stadium, the Traveler is greeted by the Natlanese. When they reach the center, they reveal their Ancient Name, to the surprise of many. Mavuika asks them to come up to her, and she reveals the name to them, who are grateful that the war would finally be over. Mavuika rouses the crowd with a rallying speech, teleporting herself and the Traveler into the Night Kingdom to end the threat for good.
They arrive at a small "pit stop" to gather their bearings and talk to the chiefs and friends from the tribes, who wish them luck on their battle. Before they leave, Mavuika tells them they needed to split up â€” much like the tumors during the invasion, the enemy had a core of similar functionality. She would find and destroy the core, while the Traveler would head to the lair. Before they leave, Paimon reminds them of her support and that they aren't alone; by the time they left, Mavuika had already ventured deep into the Night Kingdom. After defeating aCryo-aligned herald, Mavuika senses a familiar presence, revealed to be her sister,Hine, who promises to support her.
Elsewhere, the Traveler approaches a pylon guarded by riftwolves, only for a group of Natlanese led by Atea to emerge and assist them in eliminating it. The Traveler tells Atea that the square behind them could allow her to talk to Mualani again, though Atea is content enough to having met each other in a dream. She and the others remain behind to ensure the corrosion wouldn't reach the square, as doing so would mean that the Abyss could surge back into Natlan again. As they proceed past the gate, they encounter the same suffocating fog as before, just as a barrier emerges to protect them. The barrier is maintained by Mallko and Vichama, who were happy to fight together again and assist the Traveler in navigating the perilous terrain.
During a fight against severalTenebrous Mimesis,BonaandCocouikarrive to assist the Traveler and Vichama. Venturing deeper inside, they encounter a stronger mimesis, but Guthred appears and allows them to dispatch of it with ease. Bona realizes that Guthred is not from Natlan, but Guthred states that he was a story created by the Masters of the Night-Wind, thus allowing him to manifest. Eventually, the spirits reach their limit due to the Ley Lines, but encourage the Traveler to finish the enemy for the good of all people. They soon discover the path before them is destroyed and wonder how they could get through, only for Chuychu and a qucusaur to appear. Like Atea, Chuychu had visited Chasca in her dreams and is content with how fast she matured. Chuychu gives them an iktomisaurus and qucusaur to allow them to reach their destination, and they arrive at a circular arena, where the heroes 500 years ago emerge to bless the Traveler.Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night, sends several seelies to guide the Traveler to Mavuika.
The Traveler arrives to find Mavuika fightingGosoythothand arrive on the scene, avoiding all of its attempts to stop them in their tracks. Believing they wish for the agony of death, Gosoythoth transforms into a massive, sword-wielding dragon. The Lord of the Night grants the Traveler the power ofPyroin response. During the battle, Gosoythoth uses a power to control the Traveler, while Mavuika is thrown into a realm where the void tries to sow doubt in her. These attempts fail, and Mavuika declares that her fate is to end the war once and for all. Back in Teyvat, the Sacred Flame extinguishes, to everyone's horror, but Kachina manages to perk the crowd back up and strengthen them. With the newfound support, Mavuika and the Traveler destroy Gosoythoth for good, returning to Teyvat.
Mavuika holds a celebration ceremony to commemorate the Traveler's deeds in saving Natlan, with many Natlanese watching. On Natlan's behalf, Chasca bestows a feathered crown on the Traveler as they partake in the festivities, signing autographs and taking pictures with the people. At the end of the festival, Citlali arrives and tells the Traveler to follow her. She explains that despite their act, Mavuika is still slated to die. As she went to help restore the Night Kingdom, they need to figure out where they could connect to the Lord of the Night, and deduce that the fallen city ofOchkanatlanwould be their best bet. When they arrive, they find a massive rift with several eyes looking down on Teyvat, which Citlali believes is theRuler of Deathkeeping an eye on Teyvat.
Ronova states that she has no interest in Teyvat, but as the price for using her powers, declares her death as payment. Mavuika states that the Lord of the Night is still weak, and the Abyss could still pose a threat in the future. As such, by placing her life in the Sacred Flame once more. She avoids their questions about her own interests, even though the Traveler desire to have her partake in the future she created. As Ronova orders the Lord of the Night to kill Mavuika, she notices her pause and asks why. The Lord of the Night states that another approaches to take her place and must wait for them to arrive, much to Ronova's irritation.
Ororon arrives with Capitano, who knows that Mavuika should share in the future she made for her people; as for him, he had been longing for death to open the gates of the Ley Lines for his people. He reveals that his heart was modified to contain the memories and souls from the Ley Lines into knowledge, and over the years, accumulated many souls. As such, by merging his existence with the Lord of the Night, he could give them the peace they desired. Capitano wishes to get revenge on Ronova for her curse, as he, like many other Khaenri'ahns, were innocent from the atrocities committed by theFive Sinners of Khaenri'ah. Due to the immortality granted to him by her, it would create a paradox that not even she could resolve.
Capitano tells Ronova to either forsake her rules or create a paradox, and the shade seemingly picks the latter, stating that the curse must still stand. Thus, Capitano takesXbalanque's seat and fuses his life force with the Lord of the Night, preventing her from dying. The Lord of the Night expresses regret for not valuing human life now that she can live forever and returns to the Night Kingdom. Mavuika realizes that Capitano was right as Natlan still needed a leader, and the five pay their respects to him before leaving. Back at the Speaker's Chamber, Mavuika writes a letter for Hine and burns it to "send" it to her, stating how Natlan is now in peace. To pay their respects at a new monument to commemorate the fallen of the final battle against the Abyss, the Traveler leaves behind the crown that they were given earlier.
Returning to the stadium, they findSadiguatelling a story to several children, one that talks about their recent acts. He notices the Traveler but does not call them, instead focusing on his story and finishes it. Seeing that they are now celebrated as heroes in Natlan, the Traveler and Paimon leave to continue their adventures. But they decide to ask Mavuika about their next journey and also about Gnosis as well. Mavuika later reveales that Capitano had been requesting Tsaritsa to abolish his mission to steal Pyro Gnosis, which was granted. But she worries if another Harbringer will attempt to steal it. Mavuika decides that she is going to prepare for the worst-case scenario in mind, if something happened with Gnosis. She later suggests that Traveler should go to Nod-Krai instead Snezhnaya because she's aware of its situation and they have conflict with them, making it worse, so she wants Traveler to prepare for everything in Nod-Krai before going there. Additionally, she has seen Dottore's men snooping around in Natlan lately and she warns Traveler about Dottore's true plans: he wants people who have power to control all elements without needing a Vision, but she fears that would be too ambitious and also dangerous. She also suspectes that they have been investigating about Teyvat's false sky.
