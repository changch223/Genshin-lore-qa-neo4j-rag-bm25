Genshin Impact Triple Extraction with Gemini

Overview:
This script is designed to extract semantic triples from Genshin Impact story texts using Gemini 1.5 Pro.
It processes long story texts by splitting them into manageable chunks and prompting the model to return structured
(subject, relation, object) triples suitable for knowledge graph construction.

The model is guided with strict formatting rules and allowed relation types to ensure consistency and factuality.
The triples can be validated via Pydantic and optionally stored or visualized in downstream knowledge systems.

Modules:
- Triple: A Pydantic BaseModel that defines the triple structure
- generate_triples_batched(): Splits input text, sends it to Gemini, and parses triple results across all chunks
